(1, '1658140796.jpg', 'Comets are leftovers from the dawn of our solar system around 4.6 billion years ago, and consist mostly of ice coated with dark organic material. They have been referred to as \"dirty snowballs.\" They may yield important clues about the formation of our solar system. Comets may have brought water and organic compounds, the building blocks of life, to the early Earth and other parts of the solar system.', 'As theorized by astronomer Gerard Kuiper in 1951, a disc-like belt of icy bodies exists beyond Neptune, where a population of dark comets orbits the Sun in the realm of Pluto. These icy objects, occasionally pushed by gravity into orbits bringing them closer to the Sun, become the so-called short-period comets. Taking less than 200 years to orbit the Sun, in many cases their appearance is predictable because they have passed by before. Less predictable are long-period comets, many of which arrive from a region called the Oort Cloud about 100,000 astronomical units (that is, about 100,000 times the distance between Earth and the Sun) from the Sun. These Oort Cloud comets can take as long as 30 million years to complete one trip around the Sun.\r\n\r\nEach comet has a tiny frozen part, called a nucleus, often no larger than a few kilometers across. The nucleus contains icy chunks, frozen gases with bits of embedded dust. A comet warms up as it nears the Sun and develops an atmosphere, or coma. The Sun\'s heat causes the comet\'s ices to change to gases so the coma gets larger. The coma may extend hundreds of thousands of kilometers. The pressure of sunlight and high-speed solar particles (solar wind) can blow the coma dust and gas away from the Sun, sometimes forming a long, bright tail. Comets actually have two tails―a dust tail and an ion (gas) tail.\r\n\r\nMost comets travel a safe distance from the Sun―comet Halley comes no closer than 89 million kilometers (55 million miles). However, some comets, called sungrazers, crash straight into the Sun or get so close that they break up and evaporate.', 'Scientists have long wanted to study comets in some detail, tantalized by the few 1986 images of comet Halley\'s nucleus. NASA\'s Deep Space 1 spacecraft flew by comet Borrelly in 2001 and photographed its nucleus, which is about 8 kilometers (5 miles) long.\r\n\r\nNASA\'s Stardust mission successfully flew within 236 kilometers (147 miles) of the nucleus of Comet Wild 2 in January 2004, collecting cometary particles and interstellar dust for a sample return to Earth in 2006. The photographs taken during this close flyby of a comet nucleus show jets of dust and a rugged, textured surface. Analysis of the Stardust samples suggests that comets may be more complex than originally thought. Minerals formed near the Sun or other stars were found in the samples, suggesting that materials from the inner regions of the solar system traveled to the outer regions where comets formed.\r\n\r\nAnother NASA mission, Deep Impact, consisted of a flyby spacecraft and an impactor. In July 2005, the impactor was released into the path of the nucleus of comet Tempel 1 in a planned collision, which vaporized the impactor and ejected massive amounts of fine, powdery material from beneath the comet\'s surface. En route to impact, the impactor camera imaged the comet in increasing detail. Two cameras and a spectrometer on the flyby spacecraft recorded the dramatic excavation that helped determine the interior composition and structure of the nucleus.\r\n\r\nAfter their successful primary missions, the Deep Impact spacecraft and the Stardust spacecraft were still healthy and were retargeted for additional cometary flybys. Deep Impact\'s mission, EPOXI (Extrasolar Planet Observation and Deep Impact Extended Investigation), comprised two projects: the Deep Impact Extended Investigation (DIXI), which encountered comet Hartley 2 in November 2010, and the Extrasolar Planet Observation and Characterization (EPOCh) investigation, which searched for Earth-size planets around other stars on route to Hartley 2. NASA returned to comet Tempel 1 in 2011, when the Stardust New Exploration of Tempel 1 (NExT) mission observed changes in the nucleus since Deep Impact\'s 2005 encounter.', 'Comet naming can be complicated. Comets are generally named for their discoverer—either a person or a spacecraft. This International Astronomical Union guideline was developed only in the last century. For example, comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 was so named because it was the ninth short-periodic comet discovered by Eugene and Carolyn Shoemaker and David Levy. Since spacecraft are very effective at spotting comets many comets have LINEAR, SOHO or WISE in their names.', 4, '2022-07-18 10:39:56', NULL);

(1, 'Solar Eclipse', '- A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun, thereby obscuring Earth\'s view of the Sun, totally or partially. Such an alignment coincides with a new moon, indicating the Moon is closest to the plane of the Earth\'s orbit. In a total eclipse, the disk of the Sun is fully obscured by the Moon. In partial and annular eclipses, only part of the Sun is obscured.\r\n\r\nIf the Moon were in a perfectly circular orbit and in the same orbital plane as Earth, there would be total solar eclipses every new moon. Instead, because the Moon\'s orbit is tilted at about 5 degrees to Earth\'s orbit, its shadow usually misses Earth. Solar (and lunar) eclipses therefore happen only during eclipse seasons, resulting in at least two, and up to five, solar eclipses each year, no more than two of which can be total. Total eclipses are more rare because they require a more precise alignment between the centers of the Sun and Moon, and because the Moon\'s apparent size in the sky is sometimes too small to fully cover the Sun. Total solar eclipses occur rarely at a given place on Earth, on average about every 360 to 410 years.\r\n\r\nAn eclipse is a natural phenomenon. In some ancient and modern cultures, solar eclipses were attributed to supernatural causes or regarded as bad omens. Astronomers\' predictions of eclipses began in China as early as the 4th century BC; eclipses hundreds of years into the future may now be predicted with high accuracy.\r\n\r\nLooking directly at the Sun can lead to permanent eye damage, so special eye protection or indirect viewing techniques are used when viewing a solar eclipse. Only the total phase of a total solar eclipse is safe to view without protection. Enthusiasts known as eclipse chasers or umbraphiles travel to remote locations to see solar eclipses.\r\n\r\n- There are four types of solar eclipses:\r\n\r\n. A total eclipse occurs when the dark silhouette of the Moon completely obscures the intensely bright light of the Sun, allowing the much fainter solar corona to be visible. During any one eclipse, totality occurs at best only in a narrow track on the surface of Earth. This narrow track is called the path of totality.\r\nAn annular eclipse occurs when the Sun and Moon are exactly in line with the Earth, but the apparent size of the Moon is smaller than that of the Sun. Hence the Sun appears as a very bright ring, or annulus, surrounding the dark disk of the Moon.\r\n\r\n. A hybrid eclipse (also called annular/total eclipse) shifts between a total and annular eclipse. At certain points on the surface of Earth, it appears as a total eclipse, whereas at other points it appears as annular. Hybrid eclipses are comparatively rare.\r\n\r\n. A partial eclipse occurs when the Sun and Moon are not exactly in line with the Earth and the Moon only partially obscures the Sun. This phenomenon can usually be seen from a large part of the Earth outside of the track of an annular or total eclipse. However, some eclipses can be seen only as a partial eclipse, because the umbra passes above the Earth\'s polar regions and never intersects the Earth\'s surface. Partial eclipses are virtually unnoticeable in terms of the Sun\'s brightness, as it takes well over 90% coverage to notice any darkening at all. Even at 99%, it would be no darker than civil twilight.\r\n\r\n- Terminology for central eclipse:\r\n\r\nCentral eclipse is often used as a generic term for a total, annular, or hybrid eclipse. This is, however, not completely correct: the definition of a central eclipse is an eclipse during which the central line of the umbra touches the Earth\'s surface. It is possible, though extremely rare, that part of the umbra intersects with the Earth (thus creating an annular or total eclipse), but not its central line. This is then called a non-central total or annular eclipse. Gamma is a measure of how centrally the shadow strikes. The last (umbral yet) non-central solar eclipse was on April 29, 2014. This was an annular eclipse. The next non-central total solar eclipse will be on April 9, 2043.\r\n\r\n- Occurrence and cycles:\r\n\r\nTotal solar eclipses are rare events. Although they occur somewhere on Earth every 18 months on average, it is estimated that they recur at any given place only once every 360 to 410 years, on average. The total eclipse lasts for only a maximum of a few minutes at any location, because the Moon\'s umbra moves eastward at over 1700 km/h. Totality currently can never last more than 7 min 32 s. This value changes over the millennia and is currently decreasing. By the 8th millennium, the longest theoretically possible total eclipse will be less than 7 min 2 s. The last time an eclipse longer than 7 minutes occurred was June 30, 1973 (7 min 3 sec). Observers aboard a Concorde supersonic aircraft were able to stretch totality for this eclipse to about 74 minutes by flying along the path of the Moon\'s umbra. The next total eclipse exceeding seven minutes in duration will not occur until June 25, 2150. The longest total solar eclipse during the 11,000 year period from 3000 BC to at least 8000 AD will occur on July 16, 2186, when totality will last 7 min 29 s. For comparison, the longest total eclipse of the 20th century at 7 min 8 s occurred on June 20, 1955, and there are no total solar eclipses over 7 min in duration in the 21st century.\r\nIt is possible to predict other eclipses using eclipse cycles. The saros is probably the best known and one of the most accurate. A saros lasts 6,585.3 days (a little over 18 years), which means that, after this period, a practically identical eclipse will occur. The most notable difference will be a westward shift of about 120° in longitude (due to the 0.3 days) and a little in latitude (north-south for odd-numbered cycles, the reverse for even-numbered ones). A saros series always starts with a partial eclipse near one of Earth\'s polar regions, then shifts over the globe through a series of annular or total eclipses, and ends with a partial eclipse at the opposite polar region. A saros series lasts 1226 to 1550 years and 69 to 87 eclipses, with about 40 to 60 of them being central.\r\n\r\n- Viewing:\r\n\r\nLooking directly at the photosphere of the Sun (the bright disk of the Sun itself), even for just a few seconds, can cause permanent damage to the retina of the eye, because of the intense visible and invisible radiation that the photosphere emits. This damage can result in impairment of vision, up to and including blindness. The retina has no sensitivity to pain, and the effects of retinal damage may not appear for hours, so there is no warning that injury is occurring.\r\n\r\nUnder normal conditions, the Sun is so bright that it is difficult to stare at it directly. However, during an eclipse, with so much of the Sun covered, it is easier and more tempting to stare at it. Looking at the Sun during an eclipse is as dangerous as looking at it outside an eclipse, except during the brief period of totality, when the Sun\'s disk is completely covered (totality occurs only during a total eclipse and only very briefly; it does not occur during a partial or annular eclipse). Viewing the Sun\'s disk through any kind of optical aid (binoculars, a telescope, or even an optical camera viewfinder) is extremely hazardous and can cause irreversible eye damage within a fraction of a second.\r\n\r\nThe Sun\'s disk can be viewed using appropriate filtration to block the harmful part of the Sun\'s radiation. Sunglasses do not make viewing the Sun safe. Only properly designed and certified solar filters should be used for direct viewing of the Sun\'s disk. Especially, self-made filters using common objects such as a floppy disk removed from its case, a Compact Disc, a black colour slide film, smoked glass, etc. must be avoided.\r\n\r\nThe safest way to view the Sun\'s disk is by indirect projection. This can be done by projecting an image of the disk onto a white piece of paper or card using a pair of binoculars (with one of the lenses covered), a telescope, or another piece of cardboard with a small hole in it (about 1 mm diameter), often called a pinhole camera. The projected image of the Sun can then be safely viewed; this technique can be used to observe sunspots, as well as eclipses.\r\n\r\n- Photography:\r\n\r\nPhotographing an eclipse is possible with fairly common camera equipment. In order for the disk of the Sun/Moon to be easily visible, a fairly high magnification long focus lens is needed (at least 200 mm for a 35 mm camera), and for the disk to fill most of the frame, a longer lens is needed (over 500 mm). As with viewing the Sun directly, looking at it through the optical viewfinder of a camera can produce damage to the retina, so care is recommended. Solar filters are required for digital photography even if an optical viewfinder is not used. Using a camera\'s live view feature or an electronic viewfinder is safe for the human eye, but the Sun\'s rays could potentially irreparably damage digital image sensors unless the lens is covered by a properly designed solar filter.', '1658143983.jpg', 5, '2022-07-18 12:28:47', NULL),
(2, 'Big Bang theory', 'The Big Bang theory describes how the universe expanded from an initial state of high density and temperature. It is the prevailing cosmological model explaining the evolution of the observable universe from the earliest known periods through its subsequent large-scale form. The model offers a comprehensive explanation for a broad range of observed phenomena, including the abundance of light elements, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, and large-scale structure.\r\n\r\nCrucially, the theory is compatible with Hubble–Lemaître law—the observation that the farther away a galaxy is, the faster it is moving away from Earth. Extrapolating this cosmic expansion backwards in time using the known laws of physics, the theory describes an increasingly concentrated cosmos preceded by a singularity in which space and time lose meaning (typically named \"the Big Bang singularity\"). Detailed measurements of the expansion rate of the universe place the Big Bang singularity at around 13.8 billion years ago, which is thus considered the age of the universe.\r\n\r\nAfter its initial expansion, an event that is by itself often called \"the Big Bang\", the universe cooled sufficiently to allow the formation of subatomic particles, and later atoms. Giant clouds of these primordial elements—mostly hydrogen, with some helium and lithium—later coalesced through gravity, forming early stars and galaxies, the descendants of which are visible today. Besides these primordial building materials, astronomers observe the gravitational effects of an unknown dark matter surrounding galaxies. Most of the gravitational potential in the universe seems to be in this form, and the Big Bang theory and various observations indicate that this excess gravitational potential is not created by baryonic matter, such as normal atoms. Measurements of the redshifts of supernovae indicate that the expansion of the universe is accelerating, an observation attributed to dark energy\'s existence.\r\n\r\n- Features of the model:\r\n\r\nThe Big Bang theory offers a comprehensive explanation for a broad range of observed phenomena, including the abundances of the light elements, the CMB, large-scale structure, and Hubble\'s law.[10] The theory depends on two major assumptions: the universality of physical laws and the cosmological principle. The universality of physical laws is one of the underlying principles of the theory of relativity. The cosmological principle states that on large scales the universe is homogeneous and isotropic—appearing the same in all directions regardless of location.\r\n\r\n- Timeline: \r\n\r\nAccording to the Big Bang theory, the universe at the beginning was very hot and very compact, and since then it has been expanding and cooling down.\r\n\r\nExtrapolation of the expansion of the universe backwards in time using general relativity yields an infinite density and temperature at a finite time in the past. This irregular behavior, known as the gravitational singularity, indicates that general relativity is not an adequate description of the laws of physics in this regime. Models based on general relativity alone can not extrapolate toward the singularity—before the end of the so-called Planck epoch.\r\n\r\nThis primordial singularity is itself sometimes called \"the Big Bang\", but the term can also refer to a more generic early hot, dense phase of the universe. In either case, \"the Big Bang\" as an event is also colloquially referred to as the \"birth\" of our universe since it represents the point in history where the universe can be verified to have entered into a regime where the laws of physics as we understand them (specifically general relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics) work. Based on measurements of the expansion using Type Ia supernovae and measurements of temperature fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background, the time that has passed since that event—known as the \"age of the universe\"—is 13.8 billion years.\r\n\r\nDespite being extremely dense at this time—far denser than is usually required to form a black hole—the universe did not re-collapse into a singularity. Commonly used calculations and limits for explaining gravitational collapse are usually based upon objects of relatively constant size, such as stars, and do not apply to rapidly expanding space such as the Big Bang. Since the early universe did not immediately collapse into a multitude of black holes, matter at that time must have been very evenly distributed with a negligible density gradient.\r\n\r\n- History:\r\n\r\nEnglish astronomer Fred Hoyle is credited with coining the term \"Big Bang\" during a talk for a March 1949 BBC Radio broadcast, saying: \"These theories were based on the hypothesis that all the matter in the universe was created in one big bang at a particular time in the remote past.\" However, it did not catch on until the 1970s.\r\n\r\nIt is popularly reported that Hoyle, who favored an alternative \"steady-state\" cosmological model, intended this to be pejorative, but Hoyle explicitly denied this and said it was just a striking image meant to highlight the difference between the two models. Helge Kragh writes that the evidence for the claim that it was meant as a pejorative is \"unconvincing\", and mentions a number of indications that it was not a pejorative.\r\n\r\nThe term itself is a misnomer as it implies the occurrence of an explosion. However, an explosion implies expansion from a center point out into the surrounding space. Rather than expanding into space, the Big Bang was the expansion/stretching of space itself, everywhere simultaneously (not from a single point), causing the universe to cool down and the density to be lowered, which is a much harder concept to grasp. Another issue pointed out by Santhosh Mathew is that bang implies sound, which would require a vibrating particle and medium through which it travels. Since this is the beginning of anything we can imagine, there is no basis for any sound, and thus the Big Bang was likely silent. An attempt to find a more suitable alternative was not successful.\r\n\r\nThe Big Bang theory developed from observations of the structure of the universe and from theoretical considerations. In 1912, Vesto Slipher measured the first Doppler shift of a \"spiral nebula\" (spiral nebula is the obsolete term for spiral galaxies), and soon discovered that almost all such nebulae were receding from Earth. He did not grasp the cosmological implications of this fact, and indeed at the time it was highly controversial whether or not these nebulae were \"island universes\" outside our Milky Way. Ten years later, Alexander Friedmann, a Russian cosmologist and mathematician, derived the Friedmann equations from Einstein field equations, showing that the universe might be expanding in contrast to the static universe model advocated by Albert Einstein at that time.\r\n\r\n- Ultimate fate of the universe:\r\n\r\nBefore observations of dark energy, cosmologists considered two scenarios for the future of the universe. If the mass density of the universe were greater than the critical density, then the universe would reach a maximum size and then begin to collapse. It would become denser and hotter again, ending with a state similar to that in which it started—a Big Crunch.\r\n\r\n- Misconceptions:\r\n\r\nOne of the common misconceptions about the Big Bang model is that it fully explains the origin of the universe. However, the Big Bang model does not describe how energy, time, and space were caused, but rather it describes the emergence of the present universe from an ultra-dense and high-temperature initial state. It is misleading to visualize the Big Bang by comparing its size to everyday objects. When the size of the universe at Big Bang is described, it refers to the size of the observable universe, and not the entire universe.\r\n\r\n- Pre–Big Bang cosmology:\r\n\r\nThe Big Bang explains the evolution of the universe from a starting density and temperature that is well beyond humanity\'s capability to replicate, so extrapolations to the most extreme conditions and earliest times are necessarily more speculative. Lemaître called this initial state the \"primeval atom\" while Gamow called the material \"ylem\". How the initial state of the universe originated is still an open question, but the Big Bang model does constrain some of its characteristics. For example, specific laws of nature most likely came to existence in a random way, but as inflation models show, some combinations of these are far more probable. A flat universe implies a balance between gravitational potential energy and other energy forms, requiring no additional energy to be created.\r\n\r\n- Religious and philosophical interpretations:\r\n\r\nAs a description of the origin of the universe, the Big Bang has significant bearing on religion and philosophy. As a result, it has become one of the liveliest areas in the discourse between science and religion. Some believe the Big Bang implies a creator, while others argue that Big Bang cosmology makes the notion of a creator superfluous.', '1658141128.jpg', 5, '2022-07-18 12:26:28', NULL),
(3, 'Evolution of Earth', 'The continental crust contains the historical record of our planet. Its most ancient rocks are four billion years old, and the youngest ones are still forming today. Parts of the continental crust may be older than four billion years, but if so, they are not exposed, or have not been found, on the Earth’s surface. The rocks of the crust convey the story of how the planet has been transformed between the period shortly after its formation and the way we see it today.\r\n\r\n- How Did the Earth Form?\r\nThe Sun and its family of planets formed when a cloud of dust and gas condensed 4.6 billion years ago. Several hundred million years after the Earth took form, an outer crust developed. But these surface rocks are no longer available for study: they have disappeared into the interior of our dynamic planet. Our only clues to how the Earth formed come from meteorites and the Moon because both formed simultaneously with the planets.\r\n\r\n- What Is the Earth Made Of?\r\nThe great bulk of our planet is composed of oxygen, iron, silicon, and magnesium. Since the Earth formed relatively close to the Sun by the aggregation of smaller solid bodies, it is a rocky, solid planet whose atmosphere formed later. The more remote, giant gas planets, from Jupiter to Neptune, formed predominantly from the lighter, more volatile elements, like hydrogen and helium.\r\nAs the Earth started to grow, about 4.56 billion years ago, the heavy iron sank to the center, and the lighter silicates rose to the surface. Heat generated from impacts of other bodies kept the early Earth molten. In fact, the planet’s entire outer layer may have been liquid, an idea that came from studying the Moon. Rocks of the lunar highlands are believed to have solidified from a similar ocean of molten rock, or magma. Unlike the Earth, the Moon is geologically inactive; thus, the cold, solid crust of its magma ocean still exists.\r\n\r\n- The history of earth\'s formation and 25 important milestones:\r\n1. Earth was formed | 4.5 billion years ago:\r\nabout 4.5 billion years ago, the rocks scattered around the Sun were very young, collided with each other and had a mass large enough to attract the surrounding gas dust under the influence of the gravity that formed the Earth. The moon, the earth\'s only satellite, was born shortly thereafter.\r\n\r\n2. First germs | 3.5 billion years ago:\r\nSo far, researchers have not determined what the first cell looked like, when it was born. But the oldest fossil ever discovered is about 3.5 billion years old. This proves that the first germ of life may have appeared before. Scientists suggest that the first germ may have started from warm alkaline geysers located at the bottom of the oceans, either on the sea surface or on land.\r\n\r\n3. Photosynthesis | 3.4 billion years ago:\r\nAbout 3.4 billion years ago, thanks to the rays of the sun, the first microorganisms began to evolve. From simple molecules, they take advantage of the energy from photons to synthesize into the road. That process is called photosynthesis. But unlike today\'s plants, the first microorganisms did not \"release\" oxygen, so the Earth\'s atmosphere was still very dangerous to humans and other animals.\r\n\r\n4. The drift of continents | 3 billion years ago:\r\nThe Earth\'s crust is very hard but is in fact made up of \"icebergs\" on layers of molten magma. When the \"icebergs\" collide, one part of this one will be \"submerged\" under the other. This process is called plate tectonics or the drift of continents. The first continent on Earth, called your, was created from this process.\r\n\r\n5. The first atmospheric \"pollution\" caused by oxygen | 2.4 billion years ago:\r\nMore than a billion years ago the first photosynthesis reaction took place but it did not produce oxygen. The atmosphere on Earth was very low in oxygen at the time. But somehow, some bacteria have \"learned\" how to synthesize sugar from CO2, water, sun and release oxygen. When greenhouse gas emissions (containing CO2) are \"sucked out\" by bacteria from the atmosphere, the first \"pollution\" process in Earth\'s politeness takes place that makes things cool down.\r\n\r\n6. Complex cells or symbiosis | 2-1 billion years ago:\r\nAt this time, life is still very simple, although it has been on Earth for quite some time, but they have a similar structure to modern bacteria today. But evolution has taken the sex to the next level. Organisms called eukaryote (eukaryotes) already have a more complex structure, inside they have specialized organs, the nucleus has a separate membrane separate from the rest of the cell. Eukaryotes also found their \"partners\" as pea-like objects called mitochondria capable of converting energy from organic matter into ATP. The researchers suggest that mitochondria were initially bacteria that lived separately in the outside world rather than being born inside cells. But thanks to symbiosis or cell absorption, these bacteria cooperate with eukaryotes and generate energy for them. Every animal and plant we see today has cells that are eukaryotes.\r\n\r\n7. First sex appearance | 1.2 billion years ago:\r\nThe first organisms maintained and developed the race through asexual reproduction, the cells kept growing and then automatically split in half. Fossils dating back 1.2 billion years of red algae show that they have begun to have the appearance of sex-specific cells such as spores. This shows that the appearance of gender was born before that time.\r\n\r\n8. Multicellular organisms appeared | 1 billion years ago:\r\nThere are fossils dating back 2.1 billion years that show that many known bacteria live in a community form to be larger in size, but when necessary they can still exist as single cells. About 1 billion years ago, the first multicellular organisms - with inseparable single cells - appeared. In particular, there are different groups of organisms that have chosen to evolve in a multicellular direction independently. Plants are thought to have chosen the multicellular form before animals.\r\n\r\n9. The Earth froze | 850 - 635 million years ago:\r\nAfter first being \"contaminated\" with oxygen from bacteria a few billion years ago, the Earth is once again petrified. Until now, researchers do not know what the cause of this freeze is, but that time lasted for 200 million years. Ice covers the Earth from the poles to the equator. This second period of frost is believed to have influenced the birth of the first complex animals. These are creatures that take the form of tubes or curly leaves such as ferns, ushering in a new period called the Ediacara period.\r\n\r\n10. Cambrian boom | 535 million years ago:\r\nAfter animals evolved and adapted to new environments, the Earth experienced two explosions in the number of species. During the Cambrian boom, an average of a group of new animals appeared every 10 million years. During this period, most animals had hard shells that made it easier to form fossils than before. According to the scientists, it is very likely that there have been previous \"explosions\" of other species but because they do not have a hard shell structure, it is impossible to record the existence. 45 million years later, another explosion in the number of species in each animal group occurred again, and was called the Ordovician Biodegradation Event.\r\n\r\n11. Plants invaded the mainland | 465 million years ago:\r\nFor billions of years, water has always been the cradle of life on Earth. It wasn\'t until 500 million years ago that some animals tried to land but not to live, but to find a place to lay eggs to stay away from underwater enemies. In contrast, plants were the first \"permanent\" inhabitants on land. Relatives of green algae were the first plants to colonize the mainland, but they quickly evolved and branched out to different species.\r\n\r\n12. Andean-Saharan Ice Age | 460 - 430 million years ago:\r\nThe biodiversity of the sex expanded during the Ordovician period but when this period ended, the Earth faced an extinction with the number of species decreased as much as the number of species born. At the end of the Ordovician period, the temperature on Earth dropped rapidly, and ice from the two poles covered most of the surface area. As a result, an ice age called the Andean-Saharan took place. The name is named after two sites that have discovered traces of the period, the top of the Andes and the Sahara Desert. The Andean-Saharan ice age marks the first and second largest mass extinction in terms of scale of all the extinctions ever recorded in Earth\'s history of development. It is estimated that up to 85% of marine species have been wiped out. Then, because the competing species were wiped out, the fish species grew at a breakneck rate.\r\n\r\n13. The first amphibian species | 375 million years ago:\r\nAfter the plants have settled on the ground, the animals also do not hesitate to find a new \"home\". The first is that insects crawled to the ground about 400 million years ago. But vertebrate species are also quick to follow in the footsteps of Tiktaalik, a fish that is similar in shape to salamanders, but its legs are still made up of fins. Fish such as Tiktaalik eventually evolved to four complete legs, becoming the ancestors of amphibians, reptiles and mammals. The fact that they left the water was considered a blessing because soon followed by the late Devonian extinction. This extinction \"ended\" many other aquatic species, including giant fish with iron armor-like bodies.\r\n\r\n14. Dawn of reptiles | 320 million years ago:\r\nWhen the first reptiles appeared, the Earth was in the midst of a prolonged cold period known as the Paleozoic Era. Reptiles evolved from amphibians that were similar in shape to salamanders. But unlike their ancestors, reptiles had thick, scaly skin and laid hard-shelled eggs that were different from when they were in the water. Thanks to the above advantages, reptiles quickly became the dominant species on the ground. And, although some species are extremely large in size, such as Dimetrodon up to 4.5 meters long, it is still a reptile, not a dinosaur. The era of dinosaurs is far from over.\r\n\r\n15. Pangaea supercontinent | 300 million years ago:\r\nFor the last time until now, Earth\'s continents merged once and formed a supercontinent called Pangaea. And surrounding the supercontinent is a... The super-ocean is called Panthalassa. The second phase of this \"superpower\" coexisted for up to 175 million years. 10 million years later, the continents separated again and the rest became what we see today.\r\n\r\n16. Largest extinction | 252 million years ago:\r\nAlthough not the first extinction, the late Permian extinction was the biggest challenge for the world on Earth. It is estimated that up to 96% of aquatic species and an equal number of terrestrial species disappear after this period. The reason for the extinction is still uncertain. But archaeological data suggests that a mass volcanic eruption, also known as the Siberian Traps, which caused 2 million square kilometers of the Earth\'s surface to be inundated with lava, the atmosphere inundated with toxic fumes, and ocean temperatures of up to 40°C, may have been the sinners themselves. The restoration of the sexes later ushered in a new era - the age of dinosaurs.\r\n\r\n17. The first mammal species | 220 million years ago:\r\nAt the same time dinosaurs evolved and reproduced globally, the first mammals appeared. Their ancestors were reptiles called cynodonts, with slightly dog-like faces and some may have fur. Early mammals such as Morganucodon were quite small in size and shaped like rats. Most likely they are only nocturnal because this is the time when the reptiles rest. It is theorized that it was this nocturnal activity that stimulated mammals to evolve towards the use of warm blood – helping them to keep their body temperature stable for feeding while reptiles were less active at night.\r\n\r\n18. Triassic extinction | 201 million years ago:\r\nThe Triassic was a time when dinosaurs roared all over the ground, while underwater giant reptiles such as the Ichthyosaur dominated the ocean as the top predators. But another great one exploded. The cause of this extinction has not been determined, but as a result, 80% of the species are destroyed. But soon after, the dinosaurs recovered and continued to dominate the ground. They even reach huge sizes. The largest species ever recorded, Dreadnoughtus schrani, has a mass of nearly 60 tons.\r\n\r\n19. The first bird | 160 million years ago:\r\nFirst under the water, then the ground and then the sky, life conquers it all in turn. But birds did not evolve further from mammals but were descendants of dinosaurs. Feathered dinosaurs such as Velociraptors were the ancestors of modern birds, but they had noses instead of hard beaks and hands to cling to trees instead of wings. One of the famous known birds, Archaeopteryx, lived 150 million years ago. But some recent archaeological results in China show that species such as Xiaotingia or Aurornis, have been around for longer than before.\r\n\r\n20. Flowering plants | 130 million years ago:\r\nIt may sound strange, but flowers are the most recent \"invention\" of the plant world. Despite having planted seeds on the ground 465 million years ago, for more than two-thirds of that time, no flowers have been recorded. Flowering plants appeared in the middle of the dinosaur era. Similar species of grass species have only recently appeared. The oldest fossil of grass is only 70 million years old. Of course, the grasses may have been present some time earlier.\r\n\r\n21. Death of dinosaurs | 65 million years ago:\r\nBOOM ... And you\'re extinct. 65 million years ago, a large rock from outer space crashed into Earth at a location corresponding to present-day Mexico. The collision was horrifying, but its long-term consequences were even worse. Dust is thrown into the upper atmosphere and obscures the sun, leading to a period of cold and dark lingering across the entire planet. In the largest number, dinosaurs of course suffered a lot. Other predators as well as other giant reptiles were also wiped out. But smaller species survived by consuming less food. It is also the fifth recorded extinction and the last to date.\r\n\r\n22. The first primates to appear | 60-55 million years ago:\r\nThe disappearance of most dinosaur species has enabled mammals to grow and proliferate. They quickly evolved towards having a uterus and raising young in the abdomen thanks to the placenta. However, there is still a long way to go before reaching humans. Some mammals began to evolve towards climbing and living in trees, as a way to avoid other predators. This method led to the birth of monkeys, apes and eventually humans. But the first primate was very small in size. The oldest primate fossil skeleton belongs to a species called Archicebus achilles, which weighs less than 30 grams. They live mainly in the hot and humid rainforests of Asia.\r\n\r\n23. Super photosynthetic plants | 32 - 25 million years ago:\r\nPlants have begun harnessing photosynthesis to synthesize sugar over billions of years, thanks to a process called photosynthesis. But it wasn\'t until recently that some species \"figured out\" a better way of photosynthesis, called C4 photosynthesis. C4 photosynthesis is more effective than common photosynthesis - C3. As a result, C4 plants are better able to adapt to environments with extreme conditions. Today, botanists are looking to genetically modify rice crops using C4 photosynthesis, in order to achieve higher yields for a larger population.\r\n\r\n24. The first human apes | 13 - 7 million years ago:\r\nThe first apes appeared in Africa about 25 million years ago. Then at some point, they began to separate the group into ancestors of modern apes and modern humans. It is difficult to say exactly when the event took place, but thanks to archaeology and genetic biology, we can estimate relatively. The oldest recorded human ape is Sahelanthropus tchadensis, which lived on the ground 7 million years ago.\r\n\r\n25. Modern humans | 200,000 years ago:\r\nOur species, known as Homo sapiens, is very young compared to all previous species, only a fifth of a million years compared to the 7 million years of Sahelanthropus tchadensis. But in that \"short\" time, we have left our birthplace in Africa, traveling to every continent on the planet. We\'ve even been out into space, something that all species haven\'t done before. But with the achievements, we also destroy a lot on this planet. In the last 40 years alone, 50% of wildlife has disappeared from the Earth, faster than any recorded extinction (and mass extinction). Will the sixth extinction take place in this human era? Will the 4 billion-year history of life on the planet end in the hands of humans themselves?', '1658143598.jpg', 5, '2022-07-18 12:26:43', NULL),
(4, 'Lunar Eclipse', 'A lunar eclipse occurs when the Moon moves into the Earth\'s shadow. This can occur only when the Sun, Earth, and Moon are exactly or very closely aligned (in syzygy) with Earth between the other two, which can happen only on the night of a full moon when the moon is near either lunar node. The type and length of a lunar eclipse depend on the Moon\'s proximity to the lunar node.\r\nThe reddish color of totally eclipsed Moon is caused by Earth completely blocking direct sunlight from reaching the Moon, with the only light reflected from the lunar surface has been refracted by Earth\'s atmosphere. This light appears reddish for the same reason that a sunset or sunrise does: the Rayleigh scattering of blue light.\r\n\r\nUnlike a solar eclipse, which can only be viewed from a relatively small area of the world, a lunar eclipse may be viewed from anywhere on the night side of Earth. A total lunar eclipse can last up to nearly 2 hours, while a total solar eclipse lasts only up to a few minutes at any given place, because the Moon\'s shadow is smaller. Also unlike solar eclipses, lunar eclipses are safe to view without any eye protection or special precautions, as they are dimmer than the full Moon.\r\n\r\n- Types of lunar eclipse:\r\nEarth\'s shadow can be divided into two distinctive parts: the umbra and penumbra. Earth totally occludes direct solar radiation within the umbra, the central region of the shadow. However, since the Sun\'s diameter appears about one-quarter of Earth\'s in the lunar sky, the planet only partially blocks direct sunlight within the penumbra, the outer portion of the shadow.\r\n\r\n. Penumbral lunar eclipse: this occurs when the Moon passes through Earth\'s penumbra. The penumbra causes a subtle dimming of the lunar surface, which is only visible to the naked eye when about 70% of the Moon\'s diameter has immersed into Earth\'s penumbra. A special type of penumbral eclipse is a total penumbral lunar eclipse, during which the Moon lies exclusively within Earth\'s penumbra. Total penumbral eclipses are rare, and when these occur, the portion of the Moon closest to the umbra may appear slightly darker than the rest of the lunar disk.\r\n\r\n. Partial lunar eclipse: this occurs when only a portion of the Moon enters Earth\'s umbra, while a total lunar eclipse occurs when the entire Moon enters the planet\'s umbra. The Moon\'s average orbital speed is about 1.03 km/s (2,300 mph), or a little more than its diameter per hour, so totality may last up to nearly 107 minutes. Nevertheless, the total time between the first and the last contacts of the Moon\'s limb with Earth\'s shadow is much longer and could last up to 236 minutes.\r\n\r\n. Total lunar eclipse: this occurs when the moon falls entirely within the earth\'s umbra. Just prior to complete entry, the brightness of the lunar limb-- the curved edge of the moon still being hit by direct sunlight-- will cause the rest of the moon to appear comparatively dim. The moment the moon enters a complete eclipse, the entire surface will become more or less uniformly bright. Later, as the moon\'s opposite limb is struck by sunlight, the overall disk will again become obscured. This is because as viewed from the Earth, the brightness of a lunar limb is generally greater than that of the rest of the surface due to reflections from the many surface irregularities within the limb: sunlight striking these irregularities is always reflected back in greater quantities than that striking more central parts, and is why the edges of full moons generally appear brighter than the rest of the lunar surface.\r\n\r\n. Central lunar eclipse: this is a total lunar eclipse during which the Moon passes through the centre of Earth\'s shadow, contacting the antisolar point. This type of lunar eclipse is relatively rare. The relative distance of the Moon from Earth at the time of an eclipse can affect the eclipse\'s duration. In particular, when the Moon is near apogee, the farthest point from Earth in its orbit, its orbital speed is the slowest. The diameter of Earth\'s umbra does not decrease appreciably within the changes in the Moon\'s orbital distance. Thus, the concurrence of a totally eclipsed Moon near apogee will lengthen the duration of totality.\r\n\r\n-  Selenelion:\r\nA selenelion or selenehelion, also called a horizontal eclipse, occurs where and when both the Sun and an eclipsed Moon can be observed at the same time. The event can only be observed just before sunset or just after sunrise, when both bodies will appear just above opposite horizons at nearly opposite points in the sky. A selenelion occurs during every total lunar eclipse-- it is an experience of the observer, not a planetary event separate from the lunar eclipse itself.\r\n\r\n- Occurrence:\r\nAt least two lunar eclipses and as many as five occur every year, although total lunar eclipses are significantly less common. If the date and time of an eclipse is known, the occurrences of upcoming eclipses are predictable using an eclipse cycle.', '1658145154.jpg', 5, '2022-07-18 12:28:36', NULL);

(5, 'Star Gaze', '- When best to Star Gaze?\r\nThe best time to observe the stars, with regard to the Moon\'s brightness, is the two weeks before and after the new moon phase. On these evenings the Moon is either absent from the sky all night, or sets within a couple of hours after sunset, or doesn\'t rise until the pre-dawn hours.\r\n\r\n- Where is best to Star Gaze?\r\nEight of the World’s Best Destinations for Stargazing:\r\n\r\n1. Atacama Desert in Chile:\r\nThis 600-mile stretch of northern Chile boasts the trifecta for ideal stargazing conditions: high altitude, unpolluted skies and the driest (non-polar) air on Earth. Unsurprisingly, the astro-tourism scene is booming. The ALMA Observatory, where the world’s most powerful radio telescope uses 66 satellite antennae to look into deep space, will be joined by a handful of other groundbreaking telescopes currently in development, while the dozen or so observatories currently scattered across the Elqui Valley draw hundreds of visitors a day. Elqui Domos, on the outskirts of the desert, offers a more personal experience: along with an observatory, the hotel features domed tents with open ceilings or timber cabins with glass roofs, which act as skylights to the world above.\r\n\r\n2. Tenerife on the Canary Islands:\r\nWith its high altitude, proximity to the Equator, and distance from tropical storms, the remote Canary Islands off mainland Morocco enjoy some of the clearest, darkest skies. What’s more, Tenerife, the largest island, passed a law that controls flight paths in order to protect its stargazing conditions. It’s also been the host of the semi-annual Starmus Festival, a celebration of science, music and the arts.  Festival attendees, which have included Neil Armstrong and Stephen Hawking, enjoy lectures, screenings and space-themed parties. Until the next gathering, visitors can tour the Teide Observatory (open April through December) or take a cable car to the top of volcanic Mount Teide for dinnertime stargazing.\r\n\r\n3. NamibRand Nature Reserve in Namibia:\r\nWhen the International Dark-Sky Association (a group that recognizes places for their sky quality) formed in 1988, its first reserve to achieve Gold Tier status (the IDA’s highest award) was Namibia’s NamibRand Nature Reserve. in the arid Namib Desert and 60 miles from the closest village. Here visitors can camp out in the arid Namib Desert and take a guided tour of the dunes. There’s also Wolwedans, a camp complex whose Mountain View Suite includes a summertime ‘star-gazing’ bed on its main veranda.\r\n\r\n4. Aoraki Mackenzie International Dark Sky Reserve in New Zealand:\r\nThe world’s largest dark-sky reserve sits on a high country plateau in New Zealand called the Mackenzie Basin, which is ringed entirely by mountains on the country’s rugged South Island. On Earth & Sky’s nighttime tour of Mt. John Observatory, used by astronomers from Japan, Germany and the U.S., visitors can spot the Magellanic Clouds—satellite galaxies of the Milky Way visible only from the southern hemisphere.\r\n\r\n5. Mauna Kea in Hawaii:\r\nPeople making the two-hour drive to the gusty 13,796-foot summit of Mauna Kea, home to the world’s largest optical telescope, have high risk for altitude sickness, but serious sky-lovers brave the elements (and low oxygen levels) for some spectacular sunrises and sunsets. The peak closes to tourists come nightfall, but the visitor’s center (at a more manageable 9,200 feet) remains open until 10 p.m. There, guests are treated to free lectures, Q&As, and a chance to peer through 11-, 14-, and 16-inch telescopes.\r\n\r\n6. Nova Scotia in Canada:\r\nIn far eastern Canada’s Acadian Skies and Mi\'kmaq Lands, a swath of wilderness in undeveloped western Nova Scotia, you’ll find the world’s first certified Starlight Hotel: Trout Point Lodge. The area was once the home of the indigenous Mi’kmaq nation, whose stories about constellations explained the changing of the seasons and other universal phenomena. Today, a resident astronomer leads guided star walks through the grounds as well as sessions on the lodge’s new stargazing platform.\r\n\r\n7. Jasper National Park in Canada:\r\nThe roads to Alberta’s Jasper National Park wend their way through spruce and pine forests, ultimately giving way to the majestic Canadian Rockies. At night, the views only get better. Much hype has been built around Jasper’s annual Dark Sky Festival, which schedules daytime solar viewings, rocket launches for kids and telescope workshops. If you can’t pass through in October, however, spring for roadside—or backcountry, if you’re truly adventurous—camping at the more than 100 sites scattered throughout the preserve, which are open year-round.\r\n\r\n8. Cherry Springs State Park in Pennsylvania:\r\nPennsylvania may not seem so far-flung, but in 2014, the northern lights—phenomena usually only witnessed in high-latitude regions—were spotted a whopping four times in the 82-acre Cherry Springs State Park. This year, aspiring astronomers are gearing up for the park’s annual Black Forest Star Party (September 22-24), which brings together hundreds of amateur observers for a weekend of communal stargazing.\r\n\r\nWhat to expect to see in a Star Gaze?\r\nThere are many incredible sights to behold when you go stargazing! From a dark sky location, the human eye can see approximately 2,500 stars without any visual aid, this compared to perhaps only 100 from a town or city.\r\n\r\nEven then, in places such as towns and cities, it’s still possible to view distant objects millions of light-years away using just a beginners telescope. Here’s a little background as to what you might see on a stargazing adventure, or if attending a public stargazing event!\r\n\r\n- The Milky Way:\r\nThe Milky Way is the name given not only to the Galaxy that we live in but also to the band of light that stretches across the sky, formed by the collective light of billions of distant stars. It’s a truly memorable experience, whenever you get to see it, and really gives a sense of our place in the Universe.\r\n\r\nThe very best time to see the Milky Way from the UK is during early Autumn when it can be viewed high overhead of an evening, its light arching from one horizon to the other. At this time the brightest region of the Milky Way, looking towards the centre of the Galaxy where the most stars are, is just about visible from the UK low in the sky (the further south you travel the higher things appear in the sky, therefore the galactic centre is best viewed from the Southern Hemisphere).\r\n\r\nThe Milky way can, however, be seen throughout the year, and whilst perhaps not as bright can still be wonderfully impressive. Another good time to view is in the early hours of the morning during the Spring months when the constellation of Cygnus (the swan) is placed high in the sky\r\n\r\n- Meteor Showers:\r\nA meteor, also known as a shooting star, is a tiny piece of dust normally only about the size of a grain of sand. These particles disintegrate as they enter Earth’s atmosphere, causing them to glow brightly as they encounter friction and disintegrate.\r\n\r\nMeteors can be seen all year round, especially from dark sky sites, however, there are periods throughout the year where they are more prolific and many can be seen in a relatively short period of time. This is due to Earth’s orbit around the Sun where it frequently encounters huge clouds of dust particles leftover from asteroids and the tails of comets, as Earth passes through these dust clouds more shooting stars can be seen.\r\n\r\nThe dates when meteor showers occur and when they peak (the time when most meteors may be seen) can be reliably predicted and occur at pretty much the same dates each year. Meteor showers are given names based on the constellation of where they appear to radiate from in the sky.\r\n\r\n- Constellation:\r\nConstellations are patterns of stars that are formally recognised by the International Astronomical Union. In Western culture, we use the shapes, characters and creatures as depicted in Greek mythology. Other cultures have their own way of looking at the skies, or “star lore“.\r\n\r\nMost people know the names of constellations that make up the signs of the Zodiac — the constellation in which the Sun is visible on their date of birth. Constellations vary in size and many of them contain quite faint stars making them difficult to locate.\r\n\r\n- Asterisms:\r\nAs well as constellations there are also asterisms — asterisms are more easily recognised patterns of stars in the sky, however, do not have an officially recognised name. The most famous asterism is the “Plough” or “Big Dipper” — the 7 bright stars that form this well-recognised pattern actually form part of the wider constellation Ursa Major (the Great Bear). Asterisms can span across constellations, the Summer Triangle for example is formed from bright stars in 3 different constellations.\r\n\r\n- Star clusters:\r\nStars can be found in clusters — sometimes in loose groups (called open clusters) that can contain several dozen stars, or in tighter balls (known as globular clusters) which can contain tens of thousands, even hundreds of thousands of stars!\r\n\r\nThere are numerous examples of star clusters scattered all over the sky and many of them look truly stunning when observed using a telescope. As they tend to be some of the brighter objects they are really good targets for beginners and novices and are “go-to” objects for observatories and outreach events.\r\n\r\n- Nebulae:\r\nA nebula is an object formed of a cloud of dust and gas — indeed, “nebula” is Latin for “cloud” or “fog”. Most are vast in size with many measured as being several light-years across (1 light year is equivalent to 5.8 trillion miles).\r\n\r\nSome nebulae are the remnants of dead stars — as a star uses up its energy through nuclear fusion it either explodes and forms a supernova remnant (if massive enough) or forms a planetary nebula, the shell of the star’s atmosphere containing all of the elements it created during its lifetime.\r\n\r\n- Galaxies:\r\nA galaxy is a gravitationally bound collection of billions of stars, most of which will have their own Solar system. Their varied shapes and sizes, along with the different angles we see them from Earth, make finding them and observing through a telescope a joy! The most famous galaxy of all, the Andromeda galaxy, is even visible to the naked eye when observed from a dark location.\r\n\r\nDistance to galaxies can range from the tens of millions of light-years to hundreds indeed thousands of millions. That they lie at such a staggering distance yet can still be observed simply by using a tube with mirrors or lenses gives testament to just how incredibly big they are! Note that whilst the human eye is very effective at seeing in low light, we do not see colour, and therefore galaxies and nebulae can only be seen in greyscale.\r\n\r\n- The Moon:\r\nThe Moon is also a great target, especially as the varying angle of light from the Sun presents a continually changing perspective, showing different phases throughout the month.\r\n\r\nThe best time to observe the Moon is when it is not fully illuminated. The most detail can be seen along the line of the “terminator”, where daytime meets nighttime, and where the low angle of sunlight creates shadows showing craters and mountains most obviously.\r\n\r\n- Planets:\r\nWith the exception of the most distant planet Neptune, all of the planets in our Solar System can be seen with the naked eye (Uranus, the second most distant, is just about visible from a dark site). Arguably the most impressive planet is Saturn, the rings visible through even a basic telescope especially when it is higher in the sky — it’s often a wow moment when people see it for the first time.\r\n\r\nJupiter also impresses with its horizontal cloud bands and “Great Red Spot”, an enormous storm system that would engulf the Earth 4 times over. The 4 Galilean Moons can also be seen as points of light when observed using binoculars and telescopes.\r\n\r\nMars can also appear incredibly impressive, especially on occasions where its orbit in the Solar System brings it near Earth. Using a telescope and on a night of good seeing, it’s possible to discern darker regions on its surface as well as its polar ice cap.\r\n\r\nPlanets are best observed when they are high in the sky in the middle of the night, however, the absolute best time to observe them is when they are directly opposite the Sun when observed from Earth. This moment of “opposition” is when the planet is fully illuminated by the Sun (in exactly the same way a full Moon is fully illuminated) and therefore appears at its brightest. Many observatories and outreach events are scheduled around these times.\r\n\r\n- Aurora:\r\nThe Aurora, or Northern Lights, are a spectacle that once seen, is never forgotten. If you are lucky enough to live in Scotland or Northern England and have a clear horizon, you may be lucky enough to see glowing arcs of light low in the sky towards the north. Occasionally the aurora is strong enough that the light-show can be seen further south, on rare occasions being seen as far south as the English south coast.\r\n\r\nThe chance of seeing aurora increases the further north you are located, hence why it is regularly spotted in countries such as Iceland, Norway and Canada. The phenomenon is caused by charged particles from the Sun which when they reach Earth are funnelled towards the magnetic poles and causing the atmosphere to glow the characteristic, green, yellow and on some occasions red and purple.\r\n\r\nDue to the nature of the charged particles being emitted from the Sun, it takes time for them to travel the ~93 million miles towards Earth, and the likelihood of Aurora can be readily predicted as much as 48 hours in advance. There are various apps for mobile phones that have aurora weather forecasts, Space Weather and Aurora Watch UK are both excellent websites.', '1658151851.jpg', 5, '2022-07-18 13:44:11', NULL),
(6, 'What a Martian meteorite can teach us about Earth\'s origins', 'What do Mars and Iceland have in common?\r\n\r\nThese days, not so much. But more than 4.5 billion years ago, it\'s possible the Red Planet had a crust comparable to Iceland today. This discovery, hidden in the oldest martian fragments found on Earth, could provide information about our planet that was lost over billions of years of geological movement and could help explain why the Earth developed into a planet that sustains a broad diversity of life and Mars did not.\r\n\r\nThese insights into Earth\'s past came out of a new study, published today in Nature Communications, by an international team that includes an NAU researcher. The study details how they found the likely martian origin of the 4.48-billion-year-old meteorite, informally named Black Beauty. Its origin is one of the oldest regions of Mars.\r\n\r\n\"This meteorite recorded the first stage of the evolution of Mars and, by extension, of all terrestrial planets, including the Earth,\" said Valerie Payré, a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Astronomy and Planetary Science. \"As the Earth lost its old surface mainly due to plate tectonics, observing such settings in extremely ancient terrains on Mars is a rare window into the ancient Earth surface that we lost a long time ago.\"\r\n\r\nWhat Mars can tell us about Earth\r\n\r\nThe team, led by Anthony Lagain from Curtin University in Australia, searched for the location of origin of a martian meteorite (officially named NWA -- Northwest Africa -- 7034 for where it was found on Earth). This meteorite, the chemistry of which indicates that Mars had volcanic activity to that found on Earth, recorded the first stage of Mars\' evolution. Although it was ejected from the surface of Mars five to 10 million years ago after an asteroid impact, its source region and geological context has remained a mystery.\r\n\r\nThis team studied chemical and physical properties of Black Beauty to pinpoint where it came from; they determined it was from Terra Cimmeria-Sirenum, one of the most ancient regions of Mars. It may have a surface similar to Earth\'s continents. Planetary bodies like Mars have impacts craters all over their surface, so finding the right one is challenging. In a previous study, Lagain\'s team developed a crater detection algorithm that uses high-resolution images of the surface of Mars to identify small impact craters, finding about 90 million as small as 50 meters in diameter. In this study, they were able to isolate the most plausible ejection site -- the Karratha crater that excavated ejecta of an older crater named Khujirt.\r\n\r\n\"For the first time, we know the geological context of the only brecciated Martian sample available on Earth, 10 years before the NASA\'s Mars Sample Return mission is set to send back samples collected by the Perseverance rover currently exploring the Jezero crater,\" said Lagain, a research fellow in the School of Earth and Planetary Sciences at Curtin. \"This research paved the way to locate the ejection site of other Martian meteorites, in order to create the most exhaustive view of the Red Planet\'s geological history.\"\r\n\r\nPayré studies the nature and formation of Mars\' crust to determine if Earth and Mars share a common past that include both a continent-like and ocean-like crust. She uses orbital observations captured in this region to investigate whether traces of volcanism similar to Iceland exist on Mars.\r\n\r\n\"As of today, Mars\' crust complexity is not understood, and knowing about the origin of these amazing ancient fragments could lead future rover and spatial missions to explore the Terra Sirenum-Cimmeria region that hides the truth of Mars\' evolution, and perhaps the Earth\'s,\" she said. \"This work paves the road to locate the ejection site of other martian meteorites that will provide the most exhaustive view of the geological history of Mars and will answer one of the most intriguing questions: why Mars, now dry and cold, evolved so differently from Earth, a flourishing planet for life?\"\r\n\r\nThe team\'s algorithm is adapted to detect impact craters constellating Mercury and the Moon, the other terrestrial bodies. This can be used to help unravel their geographical history and answer foundational questions regarding their formation and evolution. This work is a starting point to guide future investigations of the Solar System.', '1658202919.jpg', 5, '2022-07-19 03:55:19', NULL),
(7, 'Scientists discover new planet orbiting nearest star to solar system', 'Proxima d is the third planet to have been spotted circling Proxima Centauri four light years away.\r\n\r\nAstronomers have found evidence for a new planet circling Proxima Centauri, the nearest star to the sun.\r\n\r\nThe alien world is only a quarter of the mass of Earth and orbits extremely close to its parent star, at one tenth of the distance between the sun and Mercury, the solar system’s innermost planet.\r\n\r\nResearchers spotted the new planet after studying tiny wobbles in the motion of Proxima Centauri caused by the gravitational pull it exerts as it swings around the star. Observations taken with the European Southern Observatory’s Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Chile suggest the planet completes a full orbit of the star every five days.\r\n\r\nThe discovery shows that our closest stellar neighbour is “packed with interesting new worlds” within reach of further study and future exploration, said João Faria, a researcher at the Institute of Astrophysics and Space Sciences in Portugal and lead author on the study.\r\n\r\nScientists believe the planet orbits about 2.4m miles (4m km) from Proxima Centauri, meaning it is closer to the star than its habitable zone where the temperature range is just right for water to run freely. Details are published in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics.\r\n\r\nNamed Proxima d, the planet is the third – and the lightest – to be spotted around Proxima Centauri, which at four light years away is the closest star to the solar system. It joins Proxima b, a planet with a mass comparable to that of Earth, which completes an orbit every 11 days, and Proxima c, which is believed to take about five years to circle the star.\r\n\r\nThe first hints of the planet came in 2020 when astronomers were observing Proxima Centauri to confirm the existence of Proxima b. The measurements revealed a weak signal in the star’s motion that had the hallmarks of being caused by a planet orbiting every five days.\r\n\r\nFurther observations taken with an instrument on ESO’s telescope called Espresso confirmed astronomers’ suspicions that a planet was the cause and not changes in the star itself.\r\n\r\n“This is a very low mass planet, and is the third candidate around the star closest to us,” Faria said. “It shows that these planets, similar to the Earth, may be common in our galaxy, and just close by. And it makes us wonder about the possible conditions for habitability in these planet systems and if it’s possible for life to appear in other places in the universe.”', '1658155168.jpg', 11, '2022-07-18 14:39:28', NULL),
(8, 'First ever image of a multi-planet system around a sun-like star captured by ESO telescope', 'The European Southern Observatory\'s Very Large Telescope (ESO\'s VLT) has taken the first ever image of a young, Sun-like star accompanied by two giant exoplanets. Images of systems with multiple exoplanets are extremely rare, and -- until now -- astronomers had never directly observed more than one planet orbiting a star similar to the Sun. The observations can help astronomers understand how planets formed and evolved around our own Sun.\r\n\r\nJust a few weeks ago, ESO revealed a planetary system being born in a new, stunning VLT image. Now, the same telescope, using the same instrument, has taken the first direct image of a planetary system around a star like our Sun, located about 300 light-years away and known as TYC 8998-760-1.\r\n\r\n\"This discovery is a snapshot of an environment that is very similar to our Solar System, but at a much earlier stage of its evolution,\" says Alexander Bohn, a PhD student at Leiden University in the Netherlands, who led the new research published today in the Astrophysical Journal Letters.\r\n\r\n\"Even though astronomers have indirectly detected thousands of planets in our galaxy, only a tiny fraction of these exoplanets have been directly imaged,\" says co-author Matthew Kenworthy, Associate Professor at Leiden University, adding that \"direct observations are important in the search for environments that can support life.\" The direct imaging of two or more exoplanets around the same star is even more rare; only two such systems have been directly observed so far, both around stars markedly different from our Sun. The new ESO\'s VLT image is the first direct image of more than one exoplanet around a Sun-like star. ESO\'s VLT was also the first telescope to directly image an exoplanet, back in 2004, when it captured a speck of light around a brown dwarf, a type of \'failed\' star.\r\n\r\n\"Our team has now been able to take the first image of two gas giant companions that are orbiting a young, solar analogue,\" says Maddalena Reggiani, a postdoctoral researcher from KU Leuven, Belgium, who also participated in the study. The two planets can be seen in the new image as two bright points of light distant from their parent star, which is located in the upper left of the frame (click on the image to view the full frame). By taking different images at different times, the team were able to distinguish these planets from the background stars.\r\n\r\nThe two gas giants orbit their host star at distances of 160 and about 320 times the Earth-Sun distance. This places these planets much further away from their star than Jupiter or Saturn, also two gas giants, are from the Sun; they lie at only 5 and 10 times the Earth-Sun distance, respectively. The team also found the two exoplanets are much heavier than the ones in our Solar System, the inner planet having 14 times Jupiter\'s mass and the outer one six times.\r\n\r\nBohn\'s team imaged this system during their search for young, giant planets around stars like our Sun but far younger. The star TYC 8998-760-1 is just 17 million years old and located in the Southern constellation of Musca (The Fly). Bohn describes it as a \"very young version of our own Sun.\"\r\n\r\nThese images were possible thanks to the high performance of the SPHERE instrument on ESO\'s VLT in the Chilean Atacama desert. SPHERE blocks the bright light from the star using a device called coronagraph, allowing the much fainter planets to be seen. While older planets, such as those in our Solar System, are too cool to be found with this technique, young planets are hotter, and so glow brighter in infrared light. By taking several images over the past year, as well as using older data going back to 2017, the research team have confirmed that the two planets are part of the star\'s system.\r\n\r\nFurther observations of this system, including with the future ESO Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), will enable astronomers to test whether these planets formed at their current location distant from the star or migrated from elsewhere. ESO\'s ELT will also help probe the interaction between two young planets in the same system. Bohn concludes: \"The possibility that future instruments, such as those available on the ELT, will be able to detect even lower-mass planets around this star marks an important milestone in understanding multi-planet systems, with potential implications for the history of our own Solar System.\"', '1658202748.jpg', 5, '2022-07-19 03:52:28', NULL),
(9, 'Hidden companions shape the final days of dying stars', 'The Butterfly Nebula, located just under 4,000 light-years from Earth in the constellation Scorpius, is a striking example of a planetary nebula, the end stage in the evolution of a small to medium-sized star. The butterfly’s diaphanous “wings” consist of gas and dust that have been expelled from the dying star and illuminated from within by the star’s remaining core. The nebula’s symmetrical, double-lobed shape is a telltale sign that a companion star helped shape the outflowing gases. Both the primary star and its companion are hidden by the shroud of dust in the nebula’s center.\r\n\r\nBillions of years from now, as our Sun approaches the end of its life and helium nuclei begin to fuse in its core, it will bloat dramatically and turn into what’s known as a red giant star. After swallowing Mercury, Venus and Earth with hardly a burp, it will grow so large that it can no longer hold onto its outermost layers of gas and dust.\r\n\r\nIn a glorious denouement, it will eject these layers into space to form a beautiful veil of light, which will glow like a neon sign for thousands of years before fading.\r\n\r\nThe galaxy is studded with thousands of these jewel-like memorials, known as planetary nebulae. They are the normal end stage for stars that range from half the Sun’s mass up to eight times its mass. (More massive stars have a much more violent end, an explosion called a supernova.) Planetary nebulae come in a stunning variety of shapes, as suggested by names like the Southern Crab, the Cat’s Eye and the Butterfly. But as beautiful as they are, they have also been a riddle to astronomers. How does a cosmic butterfly emerge from the seemingly featureless, round cocoon of a red giant star?\r\n\r\nObservations and computer models are now pointing to an explanation that would have seemed outlandish 30 years ago: Most red giants have a much smaller companion star hiding in their gravitational embrace.

(10, '8000 kilometers per second: Star with the shortest orbital period around black hole discovered', 'Researchers at the University of Cologne and Masaryk University in Brno (Czech Republic) have discovered the fastest known star, which travels around a black hole in record time. The star, S4716, orbits Sagittarius A*, the black hole in the centre of our Milky Way, in four years and reaches a speed of around 8000 kilometres per second. S4716 comes as close as 100 AU (astronomical unit) to the black hole -- a small distance by astronomical standards. One AU corresponds to 149,597,870 kilometres. The study has been published in The Astrophysical Journal.\r\n\r\nIn the vicinity of the black hole at the centre of our galaxy is a densely packed cluster of stars. This cluster, called S cluster, is home to well over a hundred stars that differ in their brightness and mass. S stars move particularly fast. \'One prominent member, S2, behaves like a large person sitting in front of you in a movie theatre: it blocks your view of what\'s important,\' said Dr Florian Peissker, lead author of the new study. \'The view into the centre of our galaxy is therefore often obscured by S2. However, in brief moments we can observe the surroundings of the central black hole.\'\r\n\r\nBy means of continuously refining methods of analysis, together with observations covering almost twenty years, the scientist now identified without a doubt a star that travels around the central supermassive black hole in just four years. A total of five telescopes observed the star, with four of these five being combined into one large telescope to allow even more accurate and detailed observations. \'For a star to be in a stable orbit so close and fast in the vicinity of a supermassive black hole was completely unexpected and marks the limit that can be observed with traditional telescopes,\' said Peissker.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the discovery sheds new light on the origin and evolution of the orbit of fast-moving stars in the heart of the Milky Way. \'The short-period, compact orbit of S4716 is quite puzzling,\' Michael Zajaček, an astrophysicist at Masaryk University in Brno who was involved in the study, said. \'Stars cannot form so easily near the black hole. S4716 had to move inwards, for example by approaching other stars and objects in the S cluster, which caused its orbit to shrink significantly,\' he added.', '1658202222.jpg', 5, '2022-07-19 03:43:42', NULL),
(11, 'Odd behavior of star reveals lonely black hole hiding in giant star cluster', 'Astronomers using ESO\'s MUSE instrument on the Very Large Telescope in Chile have discovered a star in the cluster NGC 3201 that is behaving very strangely. It appears to be orbiting an invisible black hole with about four times the mass of the Sun -- the first such inactive stellar-mass black hole found in a globular cluster and the first found by directly detecting its gravitational pull. This important discovery impacts on our understanding of the formation of these star clusters, black holes, and the origins of gravitational wave events.\r\n\r\nGlobular star clusters are huge spheres of tens of thousands of stars that orbit most galaxies. They are among the oldest known stellar systems in the Universe and date back to near the beginning of galaxy growth and evolution. More than 150 are currently known to belong to the Milky Way.\r\n\r\nOne particular cluster, called NGC 3201and situated in the southern constellation of Vela (The Sails), has now been studied using the MUSE instrument on ESO\'s Very Large Telescope in Chile. An international team of astronomers has found that one of the stars [1] in NGC 3201 is behaving very oddly -- it is being flung backwards and forwards at speeds of several hundred thousand kilometres per hour, with the pattern repeating every 167 days [2].\r\n\r\nLead author Benjamin Giesers was intrigued by the star\'s behaviour: \"It was orbiting something that was completely invisible, which had a mass more than four times the Sun -- this could only be a black hole! The first one found in a globular cluster by directly observing its gravitational pull.\"\r\n\r\nThe relationship between black holes and globular clusters is an important but mysterious one. Because of their large masses and great ages, these clusters are thought to have produced a large number of stellar-mass black holes -- created as massive stars within them exploded and collapsed over the long lifetime of the cluster [3][4].\r\n\r\nESO\'s MUSE instrument provides astronomers with a unique ability to measure the motions of thousands of far away stars at the same time. With this new finding, the team have for the first time been able to detect an inactive black hole at the heart of a globular cluster -- one that is not currently swallowing matter and is not surrounded by a glowing disc of gas. They could estimate the black hole\'s mass through the movements of a star caught up in its enormous gravitational pull [5].\r\n\r\nFrom its observed properties the star was determined to be about 0.8 times the mass of our Sun, and the mass of its mysterious counterpart was calculated at around 4.36 times the Sun\'s mass -- almost certainly a black hole [6].\r\n\r\nRecent detections of radio and X-ray sources in globular clusters, as well as the 2016 detection of gravitational-wave signals produced by the merging of two stellar-mass black holes, suggest that these relatively small black holes may be more common in globular clusters than previously thought.\r\n\r\nGiesers concludes: \"Until recently, it was assumed that almost all black holes would disappear from globular clusters after a short time and that systems like this should not even exist! But clearly this is not the case -- our discovery is the first direct detection of the gravitational effects of a stellar-mass black hole in a globular cluster. This finding helps in understanding the formation of globular clusters and the evolution of black holes and binary systems -- vital in the context of understanding gravitational wave sources.\"\r\n\r\nNotes\r\n\r\n[1] The star found is a main sequence turn-off star, meaning it is at the end of the main sequence phase of its life. Having exhausted its primary hydrogen fuel supply it is now on the way to becoming a red giant.\r\n\r\n[2] A large survey of 25 globular clusters around the Milky Way is currently being conducted using ESO\'s MUSE instrument with the support of the MUSE consortium. It will provide astronomers with the spectra of 600 to 27 000 stars in each cluster. The study includes analysis of the \"radial velocity\" of individual stars -- the speed at which they move away from and toward the Earth, along the line of sight of the observer. With radial velocity measurements the orbits of stars can be determined, as well as the properties of any massive object they may be orbiting.\r\n\r\n[3] In the absence of continuous star formation, as is the case for globular clusters, stellar-mass black holes soon become the most massive objects present. Generally, stellar-mass black holes in globular clusters are about four times as massive as the surrounding low-mass stars. Recent theories have concluded that black holes form a dense nucleus within the cluster, which then becomes detached from the rest of the globular material. Movements at the centre of the cluster are then thought to eject the majority of black holes, meaning only a few would survive after a billion years.\r\n\r\n[4] Stellar-mass black holes -- or collapsars -- are formed when massive stars die, collapsing under their own gravity and exploding as powerful hypernovae. Left behind is a black hole with most of the mass of the former star, which can range from a few times the mass of our Sun to several tens of times as massive.\r\n\r\n[5] As no light is able to escape black holes because of their tremendous gravity, the primary method of detecting them is through observations of radio or X-ray emissions coming from hot material around them. But when a black hole is not interacting with hot matter and so not accumulating mass or emitting radiation, as in this case, the black hole is \"inactive\" and invisible, so another method of detection is required.\r\n\r\n[6] Because the non-luminous object in this binary system cannot be directly observed there are alternative, although much less persuasive, explanations for what it could be. It is perhaps a triple star system made up of two tightly bound neutron stars, with the observed star orbiting around them. This scenario would require each tightly bound star to be at least twice the mass of our Sun, a binary system that has never been observed before.', '1658202309.jpg', 5, '2022-07-19 03:45:09', NULL),

A survey of 800 pulsars followed by the Jodrell Bank Observatory over the last 50 years has revealed that this first detected exoplanet system may be extraordinarily uncommon: less than 0.5% of all known pulsars could host Earth-mass planets.\r\n\r\nPulsars are a type of neutron star, the densest stars in the universe, born during powerful explosions at the end of a typical star\'s life.

Pulsars emit beams of bright radio emission from their magnetic poles that appear to pulse as the star rotates.\r\n\r\n\"[Pulsars] produce signals which sweep the Earth every time they rotate, similarly to a cosmic lighthouse,\" says Nițu \"These signals can then be picked up by radio telescopes and turned into a lot of amazing science.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1992, the first ever exoplanets were discovered orbiting a pulsar called PSR B1257+12. The planetary system is now known to host at least three planets similar in mass to the rocky planets in our Solar System. Since then, a handful of pulsars have been found to host planets. However, the extremely violent conditions surrounding the births and lives of pulsars make \'normal\' planet formation unlikely, and many of these detected planets are exotic objects (such as planets made mostly of diamond) unlike those we know in our Solar System.\r\n\r\nA team of astronomers at the University of Manchester performed the largest search for planets orbiting pulsars to date. In particular, the team looked for signals that indicate the presence of planetary companions with masses up to 100 times that of the Earth, and orbital time periods between 20 days and 17 years. Of the 10 potential detections, the most promising is the system PSR J2007+3120 with the possibility of hosting at least two planets, with masses a few times bigger than the Earth, and orbital periods of 1.9 and ~3.6 years.\r\n\r\nThe results of the work indicate no bias for particular planet masses or orbital periods in pulsar systems. However, the results do yield information of the shape of these planets\' orbits: in contrast to the near-circular orbits found in our Solar System, these planets would orbit their stars on highly elliptical paths. This indicates that the formation process for pulsar-planet systems is vastly different than traditional star-planet systems.\r\n\r\nDiscussing the motivation of her research, Nițu says: \"Pulsars are incredibly interesting and exotic objects. Exactly 30 years ago, the first extra-solar planets were discovered around a pulsar, but we are yet to understand how these planets can form and survive in such extreme conditions. Finding out how common these are, and what they look like is a crucial step towards this.\"', '1658202479.jpg', 5, '2022-07-19 03:47:59', NULL),
(13, 'A blueprint for life forms on Mars?', 'Microbes taken from surface sediment near Lost Hammer Spring, Canada, about 900 km south of the North Pole, could provide a blueprint for the kind of life forms that may once have existed, or may still exist, on Mars.\r\n\r\nThe extremely salty, very cold, and almost oxygen-free environment under the permafrost of Lost Hammer Spring in Canada\'s High Arctic is the one that most closely resembles certain areas on Mars. So, if you want to learn more about the kinds of life forms that could once have existed -- or may still exist -- on Mars, this is a good place to look. After much searching under extremely difficult conditions, McGill University researchers have found microbes that have never been identified before. Moreover, by using state-of-the-art genomic techniques, they have gained insight into their metabolisms. In a recent paper in ISME, the scientists demonstrate, for the first time, that microbial communities found living in Canada\'s High Arctic, in conditions analogous to those on Mars, can survive by eating and breathing simple inorganic compounds of a kind that have been detected on Mars (such as methane, sulfide, sulfate, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide). This discovery is so compelling that samples of the Lost Hammer surface sediments were selected by the European Space Agency to test the life detection capabilities of the instruments they plan to use on the next ExoMars Mission.\r\n\r\nDeveloping a blueprint for life on Mars\r\n\r\nLost Hammer Spring, in Nunavut in Canada\'s High Arctic, is one of the coldest and saltiest terrestrial springs discovered to date. The water which travels up through 600 metres of permafrost to the surface is extremely salty (~24% salinity), perennially at sub-zero temperatures (~ -- 5 °C) and contains almost no oxygen (<1ppm dissolved oxygen). The very high salt concentrations keep the Lost Hammer spring from freezing, thus maintaining a liquid water habitat even at sub-zero temperatures. These conditions are analogous to those found in certain areas on Mars, where widespread salt deposits and possible cold salt springs have been observed. And while earlier studies have found evidence of microbes in this kind of Mars-like environment -- this is one of a very few studies to find microbes alive and active\r\n\r\nTo gain insight into the kind of life forms that could exist on Mars, a McGill University research team, led by Lyle Whyte of the Department of Natural Resource Sciences, has used state-of-the-art genomic tools and single cell microbiology methods to identify and characterize a novel, and more importantly, an active microbial community in this unique spring. Finding the microbes and then sequencing their DNA and mRNA was no easy task.\r\n\r\nIt takes an unusual life form to survive in difficult conditions\r\n\r\n\"It took a couple of years of working with the sediment before we were able to successfully detect active microbial communities,\" explains Elisse Magnuson, a PhD student in Whyte\'s lab, and the first author on the paper. \"The saltiness of the environment interferes with both the extraction and the sequencing of the microbes, so when we were able to find evidence of active microbial communities, it was a very satisfying experience.\"\r\n\r\nThe team isolated and sequenced DNA from the spring community, allowing them to reconstruct genomes from approximately 110 microorganisms, most of which have never been seen before. These genomes have allowed the team to determine how such creatures survive and thrive in this unique extreme environment, acted as blueprints for potential life forms in similar environments. Through mRNA sequencing, the team were able to identify active genes in the genomes and essentially identify some very unusual microbes actively metabolizing in the extreme spring environment.\r\n\r\nNo need for organic material to support life\r\n\r\n\"The microbes we found and described at Lost Hammer Spring are surprising, because, unlike other microorganisms, they don\'t depend on organic material or oxygen to live,\" adds Whyte. \"Instead, they survive by eating and breathing simple inorganic compounds such as methane, sulfides, sulfate, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, all of which are found on Mars. They can also fix carbon dioxide and nitrogen gasses from the atmosphere, all of which makes them highly adapted to both surviving and thriving in very extreme environments on Earth and beyond.\"\r\n\r\nThe next steps in the research will be to culture and further characterize the most abundant and active members of this strange microbial ecosystem, to better understand why and how they are thriving in the very cold, salty, muck of the Lost Hammer Spring. The researchers hope that this, in turn, will help in the interpretation of the exciting but enigmatic sulfur and carbon isotopes that were very recently obtained from the NASA Curiosity Rover in the Gale Crater on Mars.', '1658202591.jpg', 5, '2022-07-19 03:49:51', NULL);

Re-opening for public tours and programming began May 27th, 2022.\r\nThe observatory, often called \"the birthplace of modern astrophysics\", was founded in 1892 by astronomer George Ellery Hale and financed by businessman Charles T. Yerkes. It represented a shift in the thinking about observatories, from their being mere housing for telescopes and observers, to the early-20th-century concept of observation equipment integrated with laboratory space for physics and chemistry analysis.\r\nThe observatory\'s main dome houses a 40 in-diameter (102 cm) doublet lens refracting telescope, the largest refractor ever successfully used for astronomy. Two smaller domes house 40-inch (102 cm) and 24-inch (61 cm) reflecting telescopes. There are several smaller telescopes – some permanently mounted – that are primarily used for educational purposes. The observatory also holds a collection of over 170,000 photographic plates.\r\nThe Yerkes 40-inch was the largest refracting-type telescope in the world when it was dedicated in 1897, although there had been several larger reflecting telescopes. During this time, there were many questions about the merits of the various materials used to construct and design telescopes. Another large telescope of this period was the Great Melbourne Telescope, which was a reflector. In the United States, the Lick refractor had just a few years earlier come online in 1888 in California with a 91 cm lens.\r\nPrior to its installation, the telescope on its enormous German equatorial mount was shown at the World\'s Columbian Exhibition in Chicago during the time the observatory was under construction.\r\nThe observatory was a center for serious astronomical research for more than 100 years. By the 21st century, however, it had reached the end of its research life. The University of Chicago closed the observatory to the public in October 2018.

It played a major role in the history of astronomy and navigation, and because the Prime Meridian passes through it, it gave its name to Greenwich Mean Time, the precursor to today\'s Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The ROG has the IAU observatory code of 000, the first in the list.[2] ROG, the National Maritime Museum, the Queen\'s House and the clipper ship Cutty Sark are collectively designated Royal Museums Greenwich.\r\nThe observatory was commissioned in 1675 by King Charles II, with the foundation stone being laid on 10 August. The old hilltop site of Greenwich Castle was chosen by Sir Christopher Wren, a former Savilian Professor of Astronomy; as Greenwich Park was a royal estate, no new land needed to be bought. At that time the king also created the position of Astronomer Royal, to serve as the director of the observatory and to \"apply himself with the most exact care and diligence to the rectifying of the tables of the motions of the heavens, and the places of the fixed stars, so as to find out the so much desired longitude of places for the perfecting of the art of navigation.\" He appointed John Flamsteed as the first Astronomer Royal. The building was completed in the summer of 1676. The building was often called \"Flamsteed House\", in reference to its first occupant.\r\nThe scientific work of the observatory was relocated elsewhere in stages in the first half of the 20th century, and the Greenwich site is now maintained almost exclusively as a museum, although the AMAT telescope became operational for astronomical research in 2018', 3, '2022-07-17 12:11:35', '2022-07-19 06:52:37'),

(1, 'Sun', '<p>The Sun is a 4.5 billion-year-old yellow dwarf star &ndash; a hot glowing ball of hydrogen and helium &ndash; at the center of our solar system. It&rsquo;s about 93 million miles (150 million kilometers) from Earth and it&rsquo;s our solar system&rsquo;s only star. Without the Sun&rsquo;s energy, life as we know it could not exist on our home planet. From our vantage point on Earth, the Sun may appear like an unchanging source of light and heat in the sky. But the Sun is a dynamic star, constantly changing and sending energy out into space. The science of studying the Sun and its influence throughout the solar system is called heliophysics. The Sun is the largest object in our solar system. Its diameter is about 865,000 miles (1.4 million kilometers). Its gravity holds the solar system together, keeping everything from the biggest planets to the smallest bits of debris in orbit around it. Even though the Sun is the center of our solar system and essential to our survival, it&rsquo;s only an average star in terms of its size. Stars up to 100 times larger have been found. And many solar systems have more than one star. By studying our Sun, scientists can better understand the workings of distant stars. The hottest part of the Sun is its core, where temperatures top 27 million &deg;F (15 million &deg;C). The part of the Sun we call its surface &ndash; the photosphere &ndash; is a relatively cool 10,000 &deg;F (5,500 &deg;C). In one of the Sun&rsquo;s biggest mysteries, the Sun&rsquo;s outer atmosphere, the corona, gets hotter the farther it stretches from the surface. The corona reaches up to 3.5 million &deg;F (2 million &deg;C) &ndash; much, much hotter than the photosphere.</p>', '<p>The first person we know of to suggest that the Sun is a star up close (or, conversely, that stars are Suns far away) was Anaxagoras, around 450 BC. It was again suggested by Aristarchus of Samos, but this idea did not catch on.</p>', '<p>Above the photosphere is the chromosphere, the transition zone, and the corona. Not all scientists refer to the transition zone as its own region &ndash; it is simply the thin layer where the chromosphere rapidly heats and becomes the corona. The photosphere, chromosphere, and corona are all part of the Sun&rsquo;s atmosphere. (The corona is sometimes casually referred to as &ldquo;the Sun&rsquo;s atmosphere,&rdquo; but it is actually the Sun&rsquo;s upper atmosphere.) The Sun&rsquo;s atmosphere is where we see features such as sunspots, coronal holes, and solar flares. Visible light from these top regions of the Sun is usually too weak to be seen against the brighter photosphere, but during total solar eclipses, when the Moon covers the photosphere, the chromosphere looks like a fine, red rim around the Sun, while the corona forms a beautiful white crown (&quot;corona&quot; means crown in Latin and Spanish) with plasma streamers narrowing outward, forming shapes that look like flower petals. In one of the Sun&rsquo;s biggest mysteries, the corona is much hotter than the layers immediately below it. (Imagine walking away from a bonfire only to get warmer.) The source of coronal heating is a major unsolved puzzle in the study of the Sun.</p>', '<p>The Sun has been called by many names. The Latin word for Sun is &ldquo;sol,&rdquo; which is the main adjective for all things Sun-related: solar. Helios, the Sun god in ancient Greek mythology, lends his name to many Sun-related terms as well, such as heliosphere and helioseismology.</p>', '<p>The Sun could not harbor life as we know it because of its extreme temperatures and radiation. Yet life on Earth is only possible because of the Sun&rsquo;s light and energy.</p>', '1659425167.jpg', '<p>Our Sun is a medium-sized star with a radius of about 435,000 miles (700,000 kilometers). Many stars are much larger &ndash; but the Sun is far more massive than our home planet: it would take more than 330,000 Earths to match the mass of the Sun, and it would take 1.3 million Earths to fill the Sun&#39;s volume. The Sun is about 93 million miles (150 million kilometers) from Earth. Its nearest stellar neighbor is the Alpha Centauri triple star system: red dwarf star Proxima Centauri is 4.24 light-years away, and Alpha Centauri A and B &ndash; two sunlike stars orbiting each other &ndash; are 4.37 light-years away. A light-year is the distance light travels in one year, which equals about 6 trillion miles (9.5 trillion kilometers).</p>', '<p>The Sun is located in the Milky Way galaxy in a spiral arm called the Orion Spur that extends outward from the Sagittarius arm.The Sun orbits the center of the Milky Way, bringing with it the planets, asteroids, comets, and other objects in our solar system. Our solar system is moving with an average velocity of 450,000 miles per hour (720,000 kilometers per hour). But even at this speed, it takes about 230 million years for the Sun to make one complete trip around the Milky Way. The Sun rotates on its axis as it revolves around the galaxy. Its spin has a tilt of 7.25 degrees with respect to the plane of the planets&rsquo; orbits. Since the Sun is not solid, different parts rotate at different rates. At the equator, the Sun spins around once about every 25 Earth days, but at its poles, the Sun rotates once on its axis every 36 Earth days.</p>', '<p>As a star, the Sun doesn&rsquo;t have any moons, but the planets and their moons orbit the Sun.</p>', '<p>The Sun would have been surrounded by a disk of gas and dust early in its history when the solar system was first forming, about 4.6 billion years ago. Some of that dust is still around today, in several dust rings that circle the Sun. They trace the orbits of planets, whose gravity tugs dust into place around the Sun.</p>', '<p>The Sun formed about 4.6 billion years ago in a giant, spinning cloud of gas and dust called the solar nebula. As the nebula collapsed under its own gravity, it spun faster and flattened into a disk. Most of the nebula&#39;s material was pulled toward the center to form our Sun, which accounts for 99.8% of our solar system&rsquo;s mass. Much of the remaining material formed the planets and other objects that now orbit the Sun. (The rest of the leftover gas and dust was blown away by the young Sun&#39;s early solar wind.) Like all stars, our Sun will eventually run out of energy. When it starts to die, the Sun will expand into a red giant star, becoming so large that it will engulf Mercury and Venus, and possibly Earth as well. Scientists predict the Sun is a little less than halfway through its lifetime and will last another 5 billion years or so before it becomes a white dwarf.</p>', '<p>The Sun is a huge ball of hydrogen and helium held together by its own gravity. The Sun has several regions. The interior regions include the core, the radiative zone, and the convection zone. Moving outward &ndash; the visible surface or photosphere is next, then the chromosphere, followed by the transition zone, and then the corona &ndash; the Sun&rsquo;s expansive outer atmosphere. Once material leaves the corona at supersonic speeds, it becomes the solar wind, which forms a huge magnetic &quot;bubble&quot; around the Sun, called the heliosphere. The heliosphere extends beyond the orbit of the planets in our solar system. Thus, Earth exists inside the Sun&rsquo;s atmosphere. Outside the heliosphere is interstellar space. The core is the hottest part of the Sun. Nuclear reactions here &ndash; where hydrogen is fused to form helium &ndash; power the Sun&rsquo;s heat and light. Temperatures top 27 million &deg;F (15 million &deg;C) and it&rsquo;s about 86,000 miles (138,000 kilometers) thick. The density of the Sun&rsquo;s core is about 150 grams per cubic centimeter (g/cm&sup3;). That is approximately 8 times the density of gold (19.3 g/cm&sup3;) or 13 times the density of lead (11.3 g/cm&sup3;). Energy from the core is carried outward by radiation. This radiation bounces around the radiative zone, taking about 170,000 years to get from the core to the top of the convection zone. Moving outward, in the convection zone, the temperature drops below 3.5 million &deg;F (2 million &deg;C). Here, large bubbles of hot plasma (a soup of ionized atoms) move upward toward the photosphere, which is the layer we think of as the Sun&#39;s surface. Surface The Sun doesn&rsquo;t have a solid surface like Earth and the other rocky planets and moons. The part of the Sun commonly called its surface is the photosphere. The word photosphere means &quot;light sphere&quot; &ndash; which is apt because this is the layer that emits the most visible light. It&rsquo;s what we see from Earth with our eyes. (Hopefully, it goes without saying &ndash; but never look directly at the Sun without protecting your eyes.) Although we call it the surface, the photosphere is actually the first layer of the solar atmosphere. It&#39;s about 250 miles thick, with temperatures reaching about 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit (5,500 degrees Celsius). That&#39;s much cooler than the blazing core, but it&#39;s still hot enough to make carbon &ndash; like diamonds and graphite &ndash; not just melt, but boil. Most of the Sun&#39;s radiation escapes outward from the photosphere into space.</p>', '<p>The Sun generates magnetic fields that extend out into space to form the interplanetary magnetic field &ndash; the magnetic field that pervades our solar system. The field is carried through the solar system by the solar wind &ndash; a stream of electrically charged gas blowing outward from the Sun in all directions. The vast bubble of space dominated by the Sun&rsquo;s magnetic field is called the heliosphere. Since the Sun rotates, the magnetic field spins out into a large rotating spiral, known as the Parker spiral. This spiral has a shape something like the pattern of water from a rotating garden sprinkler. The Sun doesn&#39;t behave the same way all the time. It goes through phases of high and low activity, which make up the solar cycle. Approximately every 11 years, the Sun&rsquo;s geographic poles change their magnetic polarity &ndash; that is, the north and south magnetic poles swap. During this cycle, the Sun&#39;s photosphere, chromosphere, and corona change from quiet and calm to violently active. The height of the Sun&rsquo;s activity cycle, known as solar maximum, is a time of greatly increased solar storm activity. Sunspots, eruptions called solar flares, and coronal mass ejections are common at solar maximum. The latest solar cycle &ndash; Solar Cycle 25 &ndash; started in December 2019 when solar minimum occurred, according to the Solar Cycle 25 Prediction Panel, an international group of experts co-sponsored by NASA and NOAA. Scientists now expect the Sun&rsquo;s activity to ramp up toward the next predicted maximum in July 2025. Solar activity can release huge amounts of energy and particles, some of which impact us here on Earth. Much like weather on Earth, conditions in space &ndash; known as space weather &ndash; are always changing with the Sun&rsquo;s activity. &quot;Space weather&quot; can interfere with satellites, GPS, and radio communications. It also can cripple power grids, and corrode pipelines that carry oil and gas. The strongest geomagnetic storm on record is the Carrington Event, named for British astronomer Richard Carrington who observed the Sept. 1, 1859, solar flare that triggered the event. Telegraph systems worldwide went haywire. Spark discharges shocked telegraph operators and set their telegraph paper on fire. Just before dawn the next day, skies all over Earth erupted in red, green, and purple auroras &ndash; the result of energy and particles from the Sun interacting with Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. Reportedly, the auroras were so brilliant that newspapers could be read as easily as in daylight. The auroras, or Northern Lights, were visible as far south as Cuba, the Bahamas, Jamaica, El Salvador, and Hawaii. Another solar flare on March 13, 1989, caused geomagnetic storms that disrupted electric power transmission from the Hydro Qu&eacute;bec generating station in Canada, plunging 6 million people into darkness for 9 hours. The 1989 flare also caused power surges that melted power transformers in New Jersey. In December 2005, X-rays from a solar storm disrupted satellite-to-ground communications and Global Positioning System (GPS) navigation signals for about 10 minutes.</p>', '<p>The Sun doesn&rsquo;t have a solid surface like Earth and the other rocky planets and moons.

(2, 'Mercury', 'The smallest planet in our solar system and nearest to the Sun, Mercury is only slightly larger than Earth\'s Moon. From the surface of Mercury, the Sun would appear more than three times as large as it does when viewed from Earth, and the sunlight would be as much as seven times brighter.\r\n\r\nMercury\'s surface temperatures are both extremely hot and cold. Because the planet is so close to the Sun, day temperatures can reach highs of 800°F (430°C). Without an atmosphere to retain that heat at night, temperatures can dip as low as -290°F (-180°C).\r\n\r\nDespite its proximity to the Sun, Mercury is not the hottest planet in our solar system – that title belongs to nearby Venus, thanks to its dense atmosphere. But Mercury is the fastest planet, zipping around the Sun every 88 Earth days.', 'In 1631 when Thomas Harriott and Galileo Galilei observe Mercury with the newly invented telescope.', 'Instead of an atmosphere, Mercury possesses a thin exosphere made up of atoms blasted off the surface by the solar wind and striking meteoroids. Mercury\'s exosphere is composed mostly of oxygen, sodium, hydrogen, helium, and potassium.', 'Mercury is appropriately named for the swiftest of the ancient Roman gods.', 'Mercury\'s environment is not conducive to life as we know it. The temperatures and solar radiation that characterize this planet are most likely too extreme for organisms to adapt to.', '1657973821.png', 'With a radius of 1,516 miles (2,440 kilometers), Mercury is a little more than 1/3 the width of Earth. If Earth were the size of a nickel, Mercury would be about as big as a blueberry.\r\n\r\nFrom an average distance of 36 million miles (58 million kilometers), Mercury is 0.4 astronomical units away from the Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From this distance, it takes sunlight 3.2 minutes to travel from the Sun to Mercury.', 'Mercury\'s highly eccentric, egg-shaped orbit takes the planet as close as 29 million miles (47 million kilometers) and as far as 43 million miles (70 million kilometers) from the Sun. It speeds around the Sun every 88 days, traveling through space at nearly 29 miles (47 kilometers) per second, faster than any other planet.\r\n\r\nMercury spins slowly on its axis and completes one rotation every 59 Earth days. But when Mercury is moving fastest in its elliptical orbit around the Sun (and it is closest to the Sun), each rotation is not accompanied by sunrise and sunset like it is on most other planets. The morning Sun appears to rise briefly, set, and rise again from some parts of the planet\'s surface. The same thing happens in reverse at sunset for other parts of the surface. One Mercury solar day (one full day-night cycle) equals 176 Earth days – just over two years on Mercury.\r\n\r\nMercury\'s axis of rotation is tilted just 2 degrees with respect to the plane of its orbit around the Sun. That means it spins nearly perfectly upright and so does not experience seasons as many other planets do.', 'Mercury doesn\'t have moons.', 'Mercury doesn\'t have rings.', 'Mercury formed about 4.5 billion years ago when gravity pulled swirling gas and dust together to form this small planet nearest the Sun. Like its fellow terrestrial planets, Mercury has a central core, a rocky mantle, and a solid crust.', 'Mercury is the second densest planet, after Earth. It has a large metallic core with a radius of about 1,289 miles (2,074 kilometers), about 85 percent of the planet\'s radius. There is evidence that it is partly molten or liquid. Mercury\'s outer shell, comparable to Earth\'s outer shell (called the mantle and crust), is only about 400 kilometers (250 miles) thick.', 'Mercury\'s magnetic field is offset relative to the planet\'s equator. Though Mercury\'s magnetic field at the surface has just 1% the strength of Earth\'s, it interacts with the magnetic field of the solar wind to sometimes create intense magnetic tornadoes that funnel the fast, hot solar wind plasma down to the surface of the planet. When the ions strike the surface, they knock off neutrally charged atoms and send them on a loop high into the sky.', 'Mercury\'s surface resembles that of Earth\'s Moon, scarred by many impact craters resulting from collisions with meteoroids and comets. Craters and features on Mercury are named after famous deceased artists, musicians, or authors, including children\'s author Dr. Seuss and dance pioneer Alvin Ailey.\r\n\r\nVery large impact basins, including Caloris (960 miles or 1,550 kilometers in diameter) and Rachmaninoff (190 miles, or 306 kilometers in diameter), were created by asteroid impacts on the planet\'s surface early in the solar system\'s history. While there are large areas of smooth terrain, there are also cliffs, some hundreds of miles long and soaring up to a mile high. They rose as the planet\'s interior cooled and contracted over the billions of years since Mercury formed.\r\n\r\nMost of Mercury\'s surface would appear greyish-brown to the human eye. The bright streaks are called \"crater rays.\" They are formed when an asteroid or comet strikes the surface. The tremendous amount of energy that is released in such an impact digs a big hole in the ground, and also crushes a huge amount of rock under the point of impact. Some of this crushed material is thrown far from the crater and then falls to the surface, forming the rays. Fine particles of crushed rock are more reflective than large pieces, so the rays look brighter. The space environment – dust impacts and solar-wind particles – causes the rays to darken with time.\r\n\r\nTemperatures on Mercury are extreme. During the day, temperatures on the surface can reach 800 degrees Fahrenheit (430 degrees Celsius). Because the planet has no atmosphere to retain that heat, nighttime temperatures on the surface can drop to minus 290 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 180 degrees Celsius).\r\n\r\nMercury may have water ice at its north and south poles inside deep craters, but only in regions in permanent shadows. In those shadows, it could be cold enough to preserve water ice despite the high temperatures on sunlit parts of the planet.', 1, '2022-07-16 12:17:01', NULL),
(3, 'Venus', 'It\'s a cloud-swaddled planet named for a love goddess, often called Earth’s twin. But pull up a bit closer, and Venus turns hellish. Our nearest planetary neighbor, the second planet from the Sun, has a surface hot enough to melt lead. The atmosphere is so thick that, from the surface, the Sun is just a smear of light.\r\n\r\nIn some ways it is more an opposite of Earth than a twin: Venus spins backward, has a day longer than its year, and lacks any semblance of seasons. It might once have been a habitable ocean world, like Earth, but that was at least a billion years ago. A runaway greenhouse effect turned all surface water into vapor, which then leaked slowly into space. The present-day surface of volcanic rock is blasted by high temperatures and pressures. Asked if the surface of Venus is likely to be life-bearing today, we can give a quick answer: a hard “no.”\r\n\r\nFurther, Venus may hold lessons about what it takes for life to get its start ­– on Earth, in our solar system, or across the galaxy. The ingredients are all there, or at least, they used to be. By studying why our neighbor world went in such a different direction with regard to habitability, we could find out what could make other worlds right. And while it might sound absurd, we can’t rule out life on Venus entirely. Temperature, air pressure, and chemistry are much more congenial up high, in those thick, yellow clouds.', 'Galileo made his first telescopic observations of Venus in October 1610.', 'The Soviet Union landed 10 probes on the surface of Venus, but even among the few that functioned after landing, the successes were short-lived – the longest survivor lasted two hours; the shortest, 23 minutes. Photos snapped before the landers fried show a barren, dim, and rocky landscape, and a sky that is likely some shade of sulfur yellow.\r\n\r\nVenus’ atmosphere is one of extremes. With the hottest surface in the solar system, apart from the Sun itself, Venus is hotter even than the innermost planet, charbroiled Mercury. To outlive the short-lived Venera probes, your rambling sojourn on Venus would presumably include unimaginably strong insulation as temperatures push toward 900 degrees Fahrenheit (482 Celsius). You would need an extremely thick, pressurized outer shell to avoid being crushed by the weight of the atmosphere – which would press down on you as if you were 0.6 miles (1 kilometer) deep in the ocean.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere is mostly carbon dioxide – the same gas driving the greenhouse effect on Venus and Earth – with clouds composed of sulfuric acid. And at the surface, the hot, high-pressure carbon dioxide behaves in a corrosive fashion. But a stranger transformation begins as you rise higher. Temperature and pressure begin to ease.', 'The ancient Romans could easily see seven bright objects in the sky: the Sun, the Moon, and the five brightest planets (Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn). They named the objects after their most important gods. Venus, the third brightest object after the Sun and Moon, was named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty. It’s the only planet named after a female god.', 'Thirty miles up (about 50 kilometers), temperatures range from 86 to 158 Fahrenheit (30 to 70 Celsius), a range that, even at its higher-end, could accommodate Earthly life, such as “extremophile” microbes. And atmospheric pressure at that height is similar to what we find on Earth’s surface.\r\n\r\nAt the tops of Venus’ clouds, whipped around the planet by winds measured as high as 224 miles (360 kilometers) per hour, we find another transformation. Persistent, dark streaks appear. Scientists are so far unable to explain why these streaks remain stubbornly intact, even amid hurricane-force winds. They also have the odd habit of absorbing ultraviolet radiation.\r\n\r\nThe most likely explanations focus on fine particles, ice crystals, or even a chemical compound called iron chloride. Although it\'s much less likely, another possibility considered by scientists who study astrobiology is that these streaks could be made up of microbial life, Venus-style. Astrobiologists note that ring-shaped linkages of sulfur atoms, known to exist in Venus’ atmosphere, could provide microbes with a kind of coating that would protect them from sulfuric acid. These handy chemical cloaks would also absorb potentially damaging ultraviolet light and re-radiate it as visible light.\r\n\r\nSome of the Russian Venera probes did, indeed, detect particles in Venus’ lower atmosphere about a micron in length – roughly the same size as a bacterium on Earth.\r\n\r\nNone of these findings provide compelling evidence for the existence of life in Venus’ clouds. But the questions they raise, along with Venus’ vanished ocean, its violently volcanic surface, and its hellish history, make a compelling case for a return to our temperamental sister planet. There is much, it would seem, that she can teach us.', '1657974027.png', 'Our nearness to Venus is a matter of perspective. The planet is nearly as big around as Earth – 7,521 miles (12,104 kilometers) across, versus 7,926 miles (12,756 kilometers) for Earth. From Earth, Venus is the brightest object in the night sky after our own Moon. The ancients, therefore, gave it great importance in their cultures, even thinking it was two objects: a morning star and an evening star. That’s where the trick of perspective comes in.\r\n\r\nBecause Venus’ orbit is closer to the Sun than ours, the two of them – from our viewpoint – never stray far from each other. The ancient Egyptians and Greeks saw Venus in two guises: first in one orbital position (seen in the morning), then another (your “evening” Venus), just at different times of the year.\r\n\r\nAt its nearest to Earth, Venus is some 38 million miles (about 61 million kilometers) distant. But most of the time the two planets are farther apart; Mercury, the innermost planet, actually spends more time in Earth’s proximity than Venus.\r\n\r\nOne more trick of perspective: how Venus looks through binoculars or a telescope. Keep watch over many months, and you’ll notice that Venus has phases, just like our Moon – full, half, quarter, etc. The complete cycle, however, new to full, takes 584 days, while our Moon takes just a month. And it was this perspective, the phases of Venus first observed by Galileo through his telescope, that provided the key scientific proof for the Copernican heliocentric nature of the Solar System.', 'Spending a day on Venus would be quite a disorienting experience – that is, if your ship or suit could protect you from temperatures in the range of 900 degrees Fahrenheit (475 Celsius). For one thing, your “day” would be 243 Earth days long – longer even than a Venus year (one trip around the Sun), which takes only 225 Earth days. For another, because of the planet\'s extremely slow rotation, sunrise to sunset would take 117 Earth days. And by the way, the Sun would rise in the west and set in the east, because Venus spins backward compared to Earth.\r\n\r\nWhile you’re waiting, don’t expect any seasonal relief from the unrelenting temperatures. On Earth, with its spin axis tilted by about 23 degrees, we experience summer when our part of the planet (our hemisphere) receives the Sun’s rays more directly – a result of that tilt. In winter, the tilt means the rays are less direct. No such luck on Venus: Its very slight tilt is only three degrees, which is too little to produce noticeable seasons.', 'Venus has no moons.', 'Venus has no rings.', 'A critical question for scientists who search for life among the stars: How do habitable planets get their start? The close similarities of early Venus and Earth, and their very different fates, provide a kind of test case for scientists who study planet formation. Similar size, similar interior structure, both harboring oceans in their younger days. Yet one is now an inferno, while the other is the only known world – so far – to play host to abundant life. The factors that set these planets on almost opposite paths began, most likely, in the swirling disk of gas and dust from which they were born. Somehow, 4.6 billion years ago that disk around our Sun accreted, cooled, and settled into the planets we know today. Several might well have moved in closer, or farther out, as the solar system formed. Better knowledge of the formation history of Venus could help us better understand Earth’s – and those of rocky planets around other stars.', 'If we could slice Venus and Earth in half, pole to pole, and place them side by side, they would look remarkably similar. Each planet has an iron core enveloped by a hot-rock mantle; the thinnest of skins forms a rocky, exterior crust. On both planets, this thin skin changes form and sometimes erupts into volcanoes in response to the ebb and flow of heat and pressure deep beneath.\r\n\r\nOther possible similarities will require further investigation – and perhaps another visit to a planet that has hosted many Earth probes, both in orbit and (briefly) on the surface. On Earth, the slow movement of continents over thousands and millions of years reshapes the surface, a process known as “plate tectonics.” Something similar might have happened on Venus early in its history. Today a key element of this process could be operating: subduction, or the sliding of one continental “plate” beneath another, which can also trigger volcanoes. Subduction is believed to be the first step in creating plate tectonics.\r\n\r\nNASA’s Magellan spacecraft, which ended a five-year mission to Venus in 1994, mapped the broiling surface using radar. Magellan saw a land of extreme volcanism. The orbiter saw a relatively young surface, one recently reshaped (in geologic terms), and chains of towering mountains.', 'Even though Venus is similar in size to Earth and has a similar-sized iron core, the planet does not have its own internally generated magnetic field. Instead, Venus has what is known as an induced magnetic field. This weak magnetic field is created by the interaction of the Sun\'s magnetic field and the planet\'s outer atmosphere. Ultraviolet light from the Sun excites gases in Venus\' outermost atmosphere; these electrically excited gases are called ions, and thus this region is called the ionosphere (Earth has an ionosphere as well). The solar wind – a million-mile-per-hour gale of electrically charged particles streaming continuously from the Sun – carries with it the Sun\'s magnetic field. When the Sun\'s magnetic field interacts with the electrically excited ionosphere of Venus, it creates or induces, a magnetic field there. This induced magnetic field envelops the planet and is shaped like an extended teardrop, or the tail of a comet, as the solar wind blows past Venus and outward into the solar system.', 'The broiling surface of Venus has been a topic of heated discussion among planetary scientists. The traditional picture includes a catastrophic, planetwide resurfacing between 350 and 750 million years ago. In other words, Venus appears to have completely erased most traces of its early surface. The causes: volcanic and tectonic forces, which could include surface buckling and massive eruptions. But newer estimates made with help from computer models paint a different portrait. While the same forces would be at work, resurfacing would be piecemeal over an extended time. The average age of surface features could be as young as 150 million years, with some older surfaces mixed in.\r\nVenus is a landscape of valleys and high mountains dotted with thousands of volcanoes. Its surface features – most named for both real and mythical women – include Ishtar Terra, a rocky, highland area around the size of Australia near the north pole, and an even larger, South-America-sized region called Aphrodite Terra that stretches across the equator. One mountain reaches 36,000 feet (11 kilometers), higher than Mt. Everest. Notably, except for Earth, Venus has by far the fewest impact craters of any rocky planet, revealing a young surface.\r\n\r\nOn your tour of Venus, during the 117 days you’re waiting for sunset, you might stop by a volcanic crater, Sacajawea, named for Lewis and Clark’s Native American guide. Or stroll through a deep canyon, Diana, named for the Roman goddess of the hunt.\r\n\r\nOther notable features of the Venus landscape include:\r\n\r\n“Pancake” domes with flat tops and steep sides, as wide as 38 miles (62 kilometers), likely formed by the extrusion of highly viscous lava.\r\n\r\n“Tick” domes, odd volcanoes with radiating spurs that, from above, make them look like their blood-feeding namesake.\r\n\r\nTesserae, terrain with intricate patterns of ridges and grooves that suggest the scorching temperatures make rock behave in some ways more like peanut butter beneath a thin and strong chocolate layer on Venus.', 1, '2022-07-16 12:20:27', NULL),

The atmosphere affects Earth\'s long-term climate and short-term local weather and shields us from much of the harmful radiation coming from the Sun. It also protects us from meteoroids, most of which burn up in the atmosphere, seen as meteors in the night sky, before they can strike the surface as meteorites.', 'The name Earth is at least 1,000 years old.

It takes 365.25 days to complete one trip around the Sun. That extra quarter of a day presents a challenge to our calendar system, which counts one year as 365 days. To keep our yearly calendars consistent with our orbit around the Sun, every four years we add one day. That day is called a leap day, and the year it\'s added to is called a leap year.\r\n\r\nEarth\'s axis of rotation is tilted 23.4 degrees with respect to the plane of Earth\'s orbit around the Sun. This tilt causes our yearly cycle of seasons. During part of the year, the northern hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun, and the southern hemisphere is tilted away. With the Sun higher in the sky, solar heating is greater in the north producing summer there. Less direct solar heating produces winter in the south. Six months later, the situation is reversed. When spring and fall begin, both hemispheres receive roughly equal amounts of heat from the Sun.', 'Earth is the only planet that has a single moon. Our Moon is the brightest and most familiar object in the night sky. In many ways, the Moon is responsible for making Earth such a great home. It stabilizes our planet\'s wobble, which has made the climate less variable over thousands of years.\r\n\r\nEarth sometimes temporarily hosts orbiting asteroids or large rocks. They are typically trapped by Earth\'s gravity for a few months or years before returning to an orbit around the Sun. Some asteroids will be in a long “dance” with Earth as both orbit the Sun.\r\n\r\nSome moons are bits of rock that were captured by a planet\'s gravity, but our Moon is likely the result of a collision billions of years ago. When Earth was a young planet, a large chunk of rock smashed into it, displacing a portion of Earth\'s interior. The resulting chunks clumped together and formed our Moon. With a radius of 1,080 miles (1,738 kilometers), the Moon is the fifth largest moon in our solar system (after Ganymede, Titan, Callisto, and Io).\r\n\r\nThe Moon is an average of 238,855 miles (384,400 kilometers) away from Earth.

There the temperature is as high as 9,800 degrees Fahrenheit (5,400 degrees Celsius). Surrounding the inner core is the outer core. This layer is about 1,400 miles (2,300 kilometers) thick, made of iron and nickel fluids.\r\n\r\nIn between the outer core and crust is the mantle, the thickest layer. This hot, viscous mixture of molten rock is about 1,800 miles (2,900 kilometers) thick and has the consistency of caramel. The outermost layer, Earth\'s crust, goes about 19 miles (30 kilometers) deep on average on land. At the bottom of the ocean, the crust is thinner and extends about 3 miles (5 kilometers) from the seafloor to the top of the mantle.', 'Our planet\'s rapid rotation and molten nickel-iron core give rise to a magnetic field, which the solar wind distorts into a teardrop shape in space. (The solar wind is a stream of charged particles continuously ejected from the Sun.) When charged particles from the solar wind become trapped in Earth\'s magnetic field, they collide with air molecules above our planet\'s magnetic poles. These air molecules then begin to glow and cause aurorae, or the northern and southern lights.\r\n\r\nThe magnetic field is what causes compass needles to point to the North Pole regardless of which way you turn. But the magnetic polarity of Earth can change, flipping the direction of the magnetic field. The geologic record tells scientists that a magnetic reversal takes place about every 400,000 years on average, but the timing is very irregular. As far as we know, such a magnetic reversal doesn\'t cause any harm to life on Earth, and a reversal is very unlikely to happen for at least another thousand years. But when it does happen, compass needles are likely to point in many different directions for a few centuries while the switch is being made. And after the switch is completed, they will all point south instead of north.​', 'Like Mars and Venus, Earth has volcanoes, mountains, and valleys. Earth\'s lithosphere, which includes the crust (both continental and oceanic) and the upper mantle, is divided into huge plates that are constantly moving.

(6, 'Jupiter', 'Jupiter is the fifth planet from our Sun and is, by far, the largest planet in the solar system – more than twice as massive as all the other planets combined. Jupiter\'s stripes and swirls are actually cold, windy clouds of ammonia and water, floating in an atmosphere of hydrogen and helium. Jupiter’s iconic Great Red Spot is a giant storm bigger than Earth that has raged for hundreds of years.\r\n\r\nJupiter is surrounded by dozens of moons. Jupiter also has several rings, but unlike the famous rings of Saturn, Jupiter’s rings are very faint and made of dust, not ice.', 'While Jupiter has been known since ancient times, the first detailed observations of this planet were made by Galileo Galilei in 1610 with a small telescope. More recently, this planet has been visited by passing spacecraft, orbiters and probes.', 'Jupiter\'s appearance is a tapestry of colorful cloud bands and spots. The gas planet likely has three distinct cloud layers in its \"skies\" that, taken together, span about 44 miles (71 kilometers). The top cloud is probably made of ammonia ice, while the middle layer is likely made of ammonium hydrosulfide crystals. The innermost layer may be made of water ice and vapor.\r\n\r\nThe vivid colors you see in thick bands across Jupiter may be plumes of sulfur and phosphorus-containing gases rising from the planet\'s warmer interior. Jupiter\'s fast rotation – spinning once every 10 hours – creates strong jet streams, separating its clouds into dark belts and bright zones across long stretches.\r\n\r\nWith no solid surface to slow them down, Jupiter\'s spots can persist for many years. Stormy Jupiter is swept by over a dozen prevailing winds, some reaching up to 335 miles per hour (539 kilometers per hour) at the equator. The Great Red Spot, a swirling oval of clouds twice as wide as Earth, has been observed on the giant planet for more than 300 years. More recently, three smaller ovals merged to form the Little Red Spot, about half the size of its larger cousin.\r\n\r\nFindings from NASA’s Juno probe released in October 2021 provide a fuller picture of what’s going on below those clouds. Data from Juno shows that Jupiter’s cyclones are warmer on top, with lower atmospheric densities, while they are colder at the bottom, with higher densities. Anticyclones, which rotate in the opposite direction, are colder at the top but warmer at the bottom.\r\n\r\nThe findings also indicate these storms are far taller than expected, with some extending 60 miles (100 kilometers) below the cloud tops and others, including the Great Red Spot, extending over 200 miles (350 kilometers). This surprising discovery demonstrates that the vortices cover regions beyond those where water condenses and clouds form, below the depth where sunlight warms the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe height and size of the Great Red Spot mean the concentration of atmospheric mass within the storm potentially could be detectable by instruments studying Jupiter’s gravity field. Two close Juno flybys over Jupiter’s most famous spot provided the opportunity to search for the storm’s gravity signature and complement the other results on its depth.\r\n\r\nWith their gravity data, the Juno team was able to constrain the extent of the Great Red Spot to a depth of about 300 miles (500 kilometers) below the cloud tops.\r\n\r\nBelts and Zones In addition to cyclones and anticyclones, Jupiter is known for its distinctive belts and zones – white and reddish bands of clouds that wrap around the planet. Strong east-west winds moving in opposite directions separate the bands. Juno previously discovered that these winds, or jet streams, reach depths of about 2,000 miles (roughly 3,200 kilometers). Researchers are still trying to solve the mystery of how the jet streams form. Data collected by Juno during multiple passes reveal one possible clue: that the atmosphere’s ammonia gas travels up and down in remarkable alignment with the observed jet streams.\r\n\r\nJuno’s data also shows that the belts and zones undergo a transition around 40 miles (65 kilometers) beneath Jupiter’s water clouds. At shallow depths, Jupiter’s belts are brighter in microwave light than the neighboring zones. But at deeper levels, below the water clouds, the opposite is true – which reveals a similarity to our oceans.\r\n\r\nPolar Cyclones Juno previously discovered polygonal arrangements of giant cyclonic storms at both of Jupiter’s poles – eight arranged in an octagonal pattern in the north and five arranged in a pentagonal pattern in the south. Over time, mission scientists determined these atmospheric phenomena are extremely resilient, remaining in the same location.\r\n\r\nJuno data also indicates that, like hurricanes on Earth, these cyclones want to move poleward, but cyclones located at the center of each pole push them back. This balance explains where the cyclones reside and the different numbers at each pole.', 'Jupiter, being the biggest planet, gets its name from the king of the ancient Roman gods.', 'Jupiter’s environment is probably not conducive to life as we know it.

These four moons are known today as the Galilean satellites, and they\'re some of the most fascinating destinations in our solar system. Io is the most volcanically active body in the solar system. Ganymede is the largest moon in the solar system (even bigger than the planet Mercury). Callisto’s very few small craters indicate a small degree of current surface activity.

Jupiter\'s fast rotation is thought to drive electrical currents in this region, generating the planet\'s powerful magnetic field. It is still unclear if deeper down, Jupiter has a central core of solid material or if it may be a thick, super-hot and dense soup.
